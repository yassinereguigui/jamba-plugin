## Definition

Rollback on-demand means the ability to quickly and safely revert to a previous working version of your application at any time, without requiring special approval, manual intervention, or complex procedures. It should be as simple and reliable as deploying forward.

## Key Principles

1. **Fast**: Rollback completes in minutes, not hours. Target < 5 minutes.
2. **Automated**: No manual steps or special procedures. Single command or click.
3. **Safe**: Rollback is validated just like forward deployment.
4. **Simple**: Any team member can execute it without specialized knowledge.
5. **Tested**: Rollback mechanism is regularly tested, not just used in emergencies.

## What Is Improved

- **Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)**: Drops from hours to minutes
- **Deployment frequency**: Increases due to reduced risk
- **Team confidence**: Higher willingness to deploy
- **Customer satisfaction**: Faster incident resolution
- **On-call burden**: Reduced stress for on-call engineers
