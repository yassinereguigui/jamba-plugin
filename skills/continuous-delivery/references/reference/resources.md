relevant to.

## Books

### Continuous Delivery and Deployment

**Modern Software Engineering** by Dave Farley
: Farley's broader take on what it means to do software engineering well. Covers the principles
  behind CD - iterating toward a goal, getting fast feedback, working in small steps - and
  connects them to test-driven development, managing complexity, and designing for testability.
  Useful for teams that want to understand the why behind CD practices, not just the how.
: *Most relevant to: All phases*

**Continuous Delivery Pipelines** by Dave Farley
: A practical, focused guide to building CD pipelines. Farley covers pipeline design, testing
  strategies, and deployment patterns in a direct, implementation-oriented style. Start here
  if you want a concise guide to the pipeline practices in Phase 2.
: *Most relevant to: Phase 2: Pipeline*

**Continuous Delivery** by Jez Humble and Dave Farley
: The foundational text on CD. Published in 2010, it remains the most comprehensive treatment
  of the principles and practices that make continuous delivery work. Covers version control
  patterns, build automation, testing strategies, deployment pipelines, and release management.
  If you read one book before starting your migration, read this one.
: *Most relevant to: All phases*

**Accelerate** by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim
: Presents the DORA research findings that link technical practices to organizational
  performance. Covers the four key metrics (deployment frequency, lead time, change failure
  rate, MTTR) and the capabilities that predict high performance. Essential reading for anyone
  who needs to make the business case for a CD migration.
: *Most relevant to: Phase 0: Assess and Phase 3: Metrics-Driven Improvement*

**Engineering the Digital Transformation** by Gary Gruver
: Addresses the organizational and leadership challenges of large-scale delivery
  transformation. Gruver draws on his experience leading transformations at HP and other large
  enterprises. Particularly valuable for leaders sponsoring a migration who need to understand
  the change management, communication, and sequencing challenges ahead.
: *Most relevant to: Organizational leadership across all phases*

**Release It!** by Michael T. Nygard
: Covers the design and architecture patterns that make production systems resilient. Topics
  include stability patterns (circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeouts), deployment patterns, and
  the operational realities of running software at scale. Essential reading before entering
  Phase 4, where the team has the capability to deploy any change on demand.
: *Most relevant to: Phase 4: Deliver on Demand and Phase 2: Rollback*

**The DevOps Handbook** by Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Patrick Debois, and John Willis
: A practical companion to *The Phoenix Project*. Covers the Three Ways (flow, feedback, and
  continuous learning) and provides detailed guidance on implementing DevOps practices. Useful
  as a reference throughout the migration.
: *Most relevant to: All phases*

**The Phoenix Project** by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford
: A novel that illustrates DevOps principles through the story of a fictional IT organization
  in crisis. Useful for building organizational understanding of why delivery improvement
  matters, especially for stakeholders who will not read a technical book.
: *Most relevant to: Building organizational buy-in during Phase 0*

### Testing

**Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests** by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce
: The definitive guide to test-driven development in practice. Goes beyond unit testing to
  cover acceptance testing, test doubles, and how TDD drives design. Essential reading for
  Phase 1 testing fundamentals.
: *Most relevant to: Phase 1: Testing Fundamentals*

**Working Effectively with Legacy Code** by Michael Feathers
: Practical techniques for adding tests to untested code, breaking dependencies, and
  incrementally improving code that was not designed for testability. Indispensable if your
  migration starts with a codebase that has little or no automated testing.
: *Most relevant to: Phase 1: Testing Fundamentals*

### Work Decomposition and Flow

**User Story Mapping** by Jeff Patton
: A practical guide to breaking features into deliverable increments using story maps. Patton's
  approach directly supports the vertical slicing discipline required for small batch delivery.
: *Most relevant to: Phase 1: Work Decomposition*

**The Principles of Product Development Flow** by Donald Reinertsen
: A rigorous treatment of flow economics in product development. Covers queue theory, batch
  size economics, WIP limits, and the cost of delay. Dense but transformative. Reading this
  book will change how you think about every aspect of your delivery process.
: *Most relevant to: Phase 3: Optimize*

**Making Work Visible** by Dominica DeGrandis
: Focuses on identifying and eliminating the "time thieves" that steal productivity: too much
  WIP, unknown dependencies, unplanned work, conflicting priorities, and neglected work. A
  practical companion to the WIP limiting practices in Phase 3.
: *Most relevant to: Phase 3: Limiting WIP*

### Databases

**Refactoring Databases: Evolutionary Database Design** by Scott Ambler and Pramod Sadalage
: The definitive guide to managing database schema changes incrementally. Covers expand-contract
  migrations, backward-compatible schema changes, and techniques for evolving databases without
  downtime. Essential reading for teams whose deployment pipeline includes database changes.
: *Most relevant to: Phase 2: Pipeline and Phase 3: Small Batches*

### Architecture

**Building Microservices** by Sam Newman
: Covers the architectural patterns that enable independent deployment, including service
  boundaries, API design, data management, and testing strategies for distributed systems.
: *Most relevant to: Phase 3: Architecture Decoupling*

**Team Topologies** by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais
: Addresses the relationship between team structure and software architecture (Conway's Law in
  practice). Covers team types, interaction modes, and how to evolve team structures to support
  fast flow. Valuable for addressing the organizational blockers that surface throughout the
  migration.
: *Most relevant to: Organizational design across all phases*

## Recommended Reading Order

If you are starting your migration and want to read in the most useful order:

1. **Accelerate**, to understand the research and build the business case
2. **Continuous Delivery** (Humble & Farley), to understand the full picture
3. **Continuous Delivery Pipelines** (Farley), for practical pipeline implementation
4. **Working Effectively with Legacy Code**, if your codebase lacks tests
5. **The Principles of Product Development Flow**, to understand flow optimization
6. **Release It!**, before moving to continuous deployment

You do not need to read all of these before starting your migration. Start with the practices
in Phase 1, read *Accelerate* for the business case, and refer to the other resources as you
reach the relevant migration phase. The most important thing is to start delivering
improvements, not to finish a reading list.
