  Pipeline reference architectures for single-team, multi-team, and distributed service delivery, with quality gates sequenced by defect detection priority.
---

This section defines quality gates sequenced by defect detection priority and three
pipeline patterns that apply them. Quality gates are derived from the
Systemic Defect Fixes catalog and sequenced so the cheapest, fastest
checks run first.

Gates marked with **[Pre-Feature]** must be in place and passing before any new feature
work begins. They form the baseline safety net that every commit runs through. Adding
features without these gates means defects accumulate faster than the team can detect them.

Gates marked with <span class="ai-high">&#9650;</span> are enhanced by AI - the AI shifts
detection earlier or catches issues that rule-based tools miss. See the
Systemic Defect Fixes catalog for details.

## Quality Gates in Priority Sequence

The gate sequence follows a single principle: **fail fast, fail cheap**. Gates that catch
the most common defects with the least execution time run first. Each gate listed below
maps to one or more defect sources from the catalog.

### Pre-commit Gates

These run on the developer's machine before code leaves the workstation. They provide
sub-second to sub-minute feedback.

| Gate | Defect Sources Addressed | Catalog Section | Pre-Feature |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------|:-----------:|
| **Linting and formatting** | Code style consistency, preventable review noise | Process & Deployment | <span class="gate-required">Required</span> |
| **Static type checking** | Null/missing data assumptions, type mismatches | Data & State | <span class="gate-required">Required</span> |
| **Secret scanning** | Secrets committed to source control | Security & Compliance | <span class="gate-required">Required</span> |
| **SAST (injection patterns)** | Injection vulnerabilities, taint analysis | Security & Compliance | <span class="gate-required">Required</span> |
| **Race condition detection** | Race conditions (thread sanitizers, where language supports it) | Integration & Boundaries | |
| **Accessibility linting** | Missing alt text, ARIA violations, contrast failures | Product & Discovery | |
| **Solitary and sociable unit tests** | Logic errors, unintended side effects, edge cases | Change & Complexity | <span class="gate-required">Required</span> |
| **Contract tests** | Interface mismatches, wrong assumptions about external system boundaries | Integration & Boundaries | <span class="gate-required">Required</span> |
| **Timeout enforcement checks** | Missing timeout and deadline enforcement | Performance & Resilience | |
| <span class="ai-high">&#9650;</span> **AI semantic code review** | Logic errors, missing edge cases, subtle injection vectors beyond pattern matching | Process & Deployment, Security & Compliance | |

| <span class="ai-high">&#9650;</span> **AI boundary coverage analysis** | Integration boundaries missing contract tests; semantic service relationship mapping | Testing & Observability Gaps | |
| <span class="ai-high">&#9650;</span> **AI behavioral assumption detection** | Undocumented assumptions at service boundaries that contract tests don't cover | Integration & Boundaries | |

## Out-of-Pipeline Verification

The following checks are non-deterministic - they depend on live environments, external
systems, or real user behavior - and cannot be made into blocking pipeline gates without
coupling your ability to deploy to factors outside your control. They run asynchronously
or post-deployment and back up the deterministic pipeline with a continuous safety net.
Failures trigger review, alerts, or rollback decisions. They never block a commit from
reaching production.

### Integration Tests (Post-Deploy)

Integration tests validate that the
test doubles used in
contract tests still match the real services
they simulate. They are non-deterministic because they exercise real service boundaries
and their results depend on the current state of those services. They run on a schedule
or post-deployment - not on every commit - and failures trigger review, not a
pipeline block.

| Check | Defect Sources Addressed | Catalog Section | Pre-Feature |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------------|:-----------:|
| **Provider verification** | Interface drift between contract test doubles and real services | Integration & Boundaries | <span class="gate-required">Required</span> |
| **Cross-service integration validation** | Breaking changes at real service boundaries | Integration & Boundaries | <span class="gate-required">Required</span> |
| <span class="ai-high">&#9650;</span> **AI boundary coverage analysis** | Integration boundaries missing contract tests; semantic service relationship mapping | Testing & Observability Gaps | |
| <span class="ai-high">&#9650;</span> **AI behavioral assumption detection** | Undocumented assumptions at service boundaries that contract tests don't cover | Integration & Boundaries | |

### Production Verification

These run during and after deployment. They are not optional - they close the feedback loop.

| Gate | Defect Sources Addressed | Catalog Section | Pre-Feature |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------|:-----------:|
| **Health checks with auto-rollback** | Inadequate rollback capability | Process & Deployment | |
| **Canary or progressive deployment** | Batching too many changes per release | Process & Deployment | |
| **Real user monitoring and SLO checks** | Slow user-facing response times, product-market misalignment | Performance & Resilience | |
| **Structured audit logging verification** | Missing audit trails | Security & Compliance | |
| <span class="ai-high">&#9650;</span> **AI change risk scoring** | Automated risk assessment from change diff, deployment history, and blast radius analysis | Process & Deployment | |

## Pre-Feature Baseline

Without these gates passing on every commit to trunk, defects accumulate faster than the
team can detect them. If any are missing, add them before writing new features. The
Foundations phase covers how to establish
this baseline.

1. Linting and formatting
2. Static type checking
3. Secret scanning
4. SAST for injection patterns
5. Compilation / build
6. Solitary and sociable unit tests
7. Contract tests at every integration boundary
8. Dependency vulnerability scan
9. Schema migration validation

---

## Pipeline Patterns

These three patterns apply the quality gates above to progressively more complex team
and deployment topologies. Most organizations start with Pattern 1 and evolve toward
Pattern 3 as team count and deployment independence requirements grow.

1. **Single Team, Single Deployable** - one team owns one
   modular monolith with a linear pipeline
2. **Multiple Teams, Single Deployable** - multiple teams own
   sub-domain modules within a shared modular monolith, each with its own sub-pipeline
   feeding a thin integration pipeline
3. **Independent Teams, Independent Deployables** - each team
   owns an independently deployable service with its own full pipeline and API contract
   verification

## Mapping to the Defect Sources Catalog

Each quality gate above is derived from the Systemic Defect Fixes
catalog. The catalog organizes defects by origin - product and discovery, integration,
knowledge, change and complexity, testing gaps, process, data, dependencies, security, and
performance. The pipeline gates are the automated enforcement points for the systemic
prevention strategies described in the catalog.

Gates marked with <span class="ai-high">&#9650;</span> correspond to catalog entries where AI
shifts detection earlier than current rule-based automation. For expert agent patterns that
implement these gates in an agentic CD context, see
ACD Pipeline Enforcement.

When adding or removing gates, consult the catalog to ensure that no defect category loses
its detection point. A gate that seems redundant may be the only automated check for a
specific defect source.
