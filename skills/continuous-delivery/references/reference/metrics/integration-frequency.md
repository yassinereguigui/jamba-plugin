  How often developers integrate code changes to the trunk. A leading indicator of CI maturity and small batch delivery.

## Definition

Integration Frequency measures the average number of production-ready pull requests
a team merges to trunk per day, normalized by team size. On a team of five
developers, healthy continuous integration practice produces at least five
integrations per day, roughly one per developer.

This metric is a direct indicator of how well a team practices
[Continuous Integration](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html).
Teams that integrate frequently work in small batches, receive fast feedback, and
reduce the risk associated with large, infrequent merges.

integrationFrequency = mergedPullRequests / day / numberOfDevelopers

A value of 1.0 or higher per developer per day indicates that work is being
decomposed into small, independently deliverable increments.

## How to Measure

1. **Count trunk merges.** Track the number of pull requests (or direct commits)
   merged to `main` or `trunk` each day.
2. **Normalize by team size.** Divide the daily count by the number of developers
   actively contributing that day.
3. **Calculate the rolling average.** Use a 5-day or 10-day rolling window to
   smooth daily variation and surface meaningful trends.

Most source control platforms expose this data through their APIs:

- **GitHub:** list merged pull requests via the REST or GraphQL API.
- **GitLab:** query merged merge requests per project.
- **Bitbucket:** use the pull request activity endpoint.

Alternatively, count commits to the default branch if pull requests are not used.

## Targets

| Level  | Integration Frequency (per developer per day) |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Low    | Less than 1 per week                          |
| Medium | A few times per week                          |
| High   | Once per day                                  |
| Elite  | Multiple times per day                        |

The elite target aligns with trunk-based development, where developers push small
changes to the trunk multiple times daily and rely on automated testing and feature
flags to manage risk.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Meaningless commits.** Teams may inflate the count by integrating trivial or
  empty changes. Pair this metric with code review quality and defect rate.
- **Breaking the trunk.** Pushing faster without adequate test coverage leads to a
  red build and slows the entire team. Always pair Integration Frequency with build
  success rate and Change Fail Rate.
- **Counting the wrong thing.** Merges to long-lived feature branches do not count.
  Only merges to the trunk or main integration branch reflect true CI practice.
- **Ignoring quality.** If defect rates rise as integration
  frequency increases, the team is skipping quality steps. Use defect rate as a
  guardrail metric.

## Connection to CD

Integration Frequency is the foundational metric for Continuous Delivery. Without
frequent integration, every downstream metric suffers:

- **Smaller batches reduce risk.** Each integration carries less change, making
  failures easier to diagnose and fix.
- **Faster feedback loops.** Frequent integration means the CI pipeline runs more
  often, catching issues within minutes instead of days.
- **Enables trunk-based development.** High integration frequency is incompatible
  with long-lived branches. Teams naturally move toward short-lived branches or
  direct trunk commits.
- **Reduces merge conflicts.** The longer code stays on a branch, the more likely
  it diverges from trunk. Frequent integration keeps the delta small.
- **Prerequisite for deployment frequency.** You cannot deploy more often than you
  integrate. Improving this metric directly unblocks improvements to
  Release Frequency.

To improve Integration Frequency:

- Decompose stories into smaller increments using
  Behavior-Driven Development.
- Use Test-Driven Development to produce modular, independently testable code.
- Adopt feature flags or branch by abstraction to decouple integration from release.
- Practice [Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) with
  short-lived branches lasting less than one day.
