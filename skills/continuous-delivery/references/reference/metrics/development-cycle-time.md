  Average time from when work starts until it is running in production. A leading indicator of batch size and delivery flow.

## Definition

Development Cycle Time measures the elapsed time from when a developer begins work
on a story or task until that work is deployed to production and available to users.
It captures the full construction phase of delivery: coding, code review, testing,
integration, and deployment.

developmentCycleTime = productionDeployTimestamp - workStartedTimestamp

This is distinct from Lead Time, which includes the time a request
spends waiting in the backlog before work begins. Development Cycle Time focuses
exclusively on the active delivery phase.

The *Accelerate* research uses "lead time for changes" (measured from commit to
production) as a key DORA metric. Development Cycle Time extends this slightly
further back to when work starts, capturing the full development process including
any time between starting work and the first commit.

## How to Measure

1. **Record when work starts.** Capture the timestamp when a story moves to
   "In Progress" in your issue tracker, or when the first commit for the story
   appears.
2. **Record when work reaches production.** Capture the timestamp of the
   production deployment that includes the completed story.
3. **Calculate the difference.** Subtract the start time from the production
   deploy time.
4. **Report the median and distribution.** The median provides a typical value.
   The distribution (or a control chart) reveals variability and outliers that
   indicate process problems.

Sources for this data include:

- **Issue trackers** (Jira, GitHub Issues, Azure Boards): status transition
  timestamps.
- **Source control:** first commit timestamp associated with a story.
- **Deployment logs:** timestamp of production deployments linked to stories.

Linking stories to deployments is essential. Use commit message conventions (e.g.,
story IDs in commit messages) or deployment metadata to create this connection.

## Targets

| Level  | Development Cycle Time |
|--------|------------------------|
| Low    | More than 2 weeks      |
| Medium | 1 to 2 weeks           |
| High   | 2 to 7 days            |
| Elite  | Less than 2 days       |

Elite teams deliver completed work to production within one to two days of starting
it. This is achievable only when work is decomposed into small increments, the
pipeline is fast, and deployment is automated.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Marking work "Done" before it reaches production.** If "Done" means "code
  complete" rather than "deployed," the metric understates actual cycle time. The
  Definition of Done must include production deployment.
- **Skipping the backlog.** Moving items from "Backlog" directly to "Done" after
  deploying hides the true wait time and development duration. Ensure stories pass
  through the standard workflow stages.
- **Splitting work into functional tasks.** Breaking a story into separate
  "development," "testing," and "deployment" tasks obscures the end-to-end cycle
  time. Measure at the story or feature level.
- **Ignoring variability.** A low average can hide a bimodal distribution where
  some stories take hours and others take weeks. Use a control chart or histogram
  to expose the full picture.
- **Optimizing for speed without quality.** If cycle time drops but
  Change Fail Rate rises, the team is cutting corners.
  Use quality metrics as guardrails.

## Connection to CD

Development Cycle Time is the most comprehensive measure of delivery flow and sits
at the heart of Continuous Delivery:

- **Exposes bottlenecks.** A long cycle time reveals where work gets stuck:
  waiting for code review, queued for testing, blocked by a manual approval, or
  delayed by a slow pipeline. Each bottleneck is a target for improvement.
- **Drives smaller batches.** The only way to achieve a cycle time under two days
  is to decompose work into very small increments. This naturally leads to smaller
  changes, less risk, and faster feedback.
- **Reduces waste from changing priorities.** Long cycle times mean work in progress
  is exposed to priority changes, context switches, and scope creep. Shorter cycles
  reduce the window of vulnerability.
- **Improves feedback quality.** The sooner a change reaches production, the sooner
  the team gets real user feedback. Short cycle times enable rapid learning and
  course correction.
- **Subsumes other metrics.** Cycle time is affected by Integration
  Frequency, Build Duration,
  and Work in Progress. Improving any of these upstream
  metrics will reduce cycle time.

To improve Development Cycle Time:

- Decompose work into stories that can be completed and deployed within one to two
  days.
- Remove handoffs between teams (e.g., separate dev and QA teams).
- Automate the build and deploy pipeline to eliminate manual steps.
- Improve test design so the pipeline runs faster without sacrificing coverage.
- Limit Work in Progress so the team focuses on finishing
  work rather than starting new items.
