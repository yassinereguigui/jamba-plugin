These defects are caused by the act of changing existing code. The larger the change and the
longer it lives outside trunk, the higher the risk.

| Issue | Earliest Detection<br>(Automation) | Automated<br>Detection | Earlier Detection<br>with AI | Systemic<br>Prevention |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----|
| Unintended side effects | CI | Automated test suites, mutation testing frameworks, change impact analysis | <span class="ai-high">&#9650;</span> Reason about semantic change impact beyond syntactic dependencies; automated blast radius analysis | Small focused commits; trunk-based development; feature flags |
| Accumulated technical debt | CI | Complexity trends, duplication scoring, dependency cycle detection, quality gates | <span class="ai-high">&#9650;</span> Identify architectural drift, abstraction decay, and calcified workarounds | Refactoring as part of every story; dedicated debt budget |
| Unanticipated feature interactions | Acceptance Tests | Combinatorial and pairwise testing, feature flag interaction matrix | Reason about feature interactions semantically; flag conflicts testing matrices miss | Feature flags with controlled rollout; modular design; canary deployments |
| Configuration drift | CI | Infrastructure-as-code drift detection, environment diffing | <span class="ai-blocked">Current tooling sufficient</span> | Infrastructure as code; immutable infrastructure; GitOps |
