  Dysfunction symptoms grouped by business impact - unpredictable delivery, quality, and team health.
---

These are the symptoms that show up in sprint reviews, quarterly planning, and 1-on-1s. They
manifest as missed commitments, quality problems, and retention risk.

## Unpredictable delivery

- **Everything Started, Nothing Finished** - The team reports progress on many items but finishes few. Sprint commitments are routinely missed because work that seemed "almost done" stalls.
- **Work Items Take Days or Weeks to Complete** - Estimates are consistently wrong. A "3-day story" takes two weeks. Forecasting becomes unreliable.
- **Releases Are Infrequent and Painful** - The organization can only ship quarterly because each release requires weeks of stabilization. Business opportunities are lost to lead time.
- **Hardening Sprints Are Needed Before Every Release** - The team needs dedicated time to "harden" before every release. This hidden cost is not visible in velocity metrics.
- **Leadership Sees CD as a Technical Nice-to-Have** - Without leadership buy-in, improvement efforts stall and funding is at risk.
- **The Team Is Chasing DORA Benchmarks** - Metrics become targets, which distorts team behavior and undermines genuine improvement.

## Quality reaching customers

- **Production Issues Discovered by Customers** - Customers report bugs before the team knows about them. Each incident erodes trust and creates unplanned support work.
- **Staging Passes but Production Fails** - The team followed the process - tests passed, staging looked good - but production still broke. The process gives false confidence.
- **High Coverage but Tests Miss Defects** - The team reports strong test coverage numbers, but defects keep reaching production. The metric is not measuring what it appears to measure.
- **Production Problems Are Discovered Hours or Days Late** - Problems are not detected until the blast radius has grown. The mean time to detect is measured in hours or days, not minutes.
- **New Releases Introduce Regressions** - Each release breaks something that worked before because testing happens too late in the process.
- **AI-Generated Code Ships Without Developer Understanding** - Code is merged without the team understanding what it does, creating hidden quality risk.

## Coordination overhead

- **Multiple Services Must Be Deployed Together** - Deploying requires coordination across teams and services. This creates scheduling dependencies and increases the cost of every change.
- **Merge Freezes Before Deployments** - Development stops before each release so the team can stabilize. This idle time is invisible but costly.
- **The Team Is Afraid to Deploy** - Deployments are treated as risky events. The team prefers to batch and delay rather than ship frequently, which amplifies risk.
- **Releases Depend on One Person** - A single release manager creates a bus-factor risk and a bottleneck on every deployment.
- **Every Change Requires a Ticket and Approval Chain** - Heavyweight change management slows delivery without proportionally reducing risk.
- **No Evidence of What Was Deployed or When** - There is no audit trail, making compliance and incident investigation harder.

## Team health and retention

- **Team Burnout and Unsustainable Pace** - Process friction, on-call burden, and deployment stress are wearing the team down. Attrition risk is high.
- **Merging Is Painful and Time-Consuming** - Developers spend significant time resolving merge conflicts instead of building features. This is invisible overhead that slows delivery.
- **Pull Requests Sit for Days Waiting for Review** - Developers are blocked waiting for reviews. This creates frustration and drives up work-in-progress as they start new things while waiting.
- **It Works on My Machine** - Environment inconsistency means developers waste time debugging problems that only appear in certain environments. This is preventable friction.
