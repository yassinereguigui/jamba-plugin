  Why test suite speed matters for developer effectiveness and how cognitive limits set the targets.

## Why speed has a threshold

The 10-minute CI target and the preference for sub-second unit tests are not arbitrary. They are
long-standing conventions in CD practice, and they align with how human cognition handles
interrupted work. When a developer makes a change and waits for
test results, three things determine whether that feedback is useful: whether the developer still
holds the mental model of the change, whether they can act on the result immediately, and whether
the wait is short enough that they do not context-switch to something else.

Research on task interruption and working memory consistently shows that context switches are
expensive. Gloria Mark's research at UC Irvine found that it takes an average of 23 minutes for
a person to fully regain deep focus after being interrupted during a task, and that interrupted
tasks take twice as long and contain twice as many errors as uninterrupted
ones.[^mark-2008] If the test suite itself takes 30 minutes, the total cost of a single
feedback cycle approaches an hour - and most of that time is spent re-loading context, not fixing
code.

## The cognitive breakpoints

Jakob Nielsen's foundational research on response times identified three thresholds that govern
how users perceive and respond to system delays: 0.1 seconds (feels instantaneous), 1 second
(noticeable but flow is maintained), and 10 seconds (attention limit - the user starts thinking
about other things).[^nielsen-1993] These thresholds, rooted in human perceptual and
cognitive limits, apply directly to developer tooling.

Different feedback speeds produce fundamentally different developer behaviors:

| Feedback time | Developer behavior | Cognitive impact |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Under 1 second** | Feels instantaneous. The developer stays in flow, treating the test result as part of the editing cycle.[^nielsen-1993] | Working memory is fully intact. The change and the result are experienced as a single action. |
| **1 to 10 seconds** | The developer waits. Attention may drift briefly but returns without effort. | Working memory is intact. The developer can act on the result immediately. |
| **10 seconds to 2 minutes** | The developer starts to feel the wait. They may glance at another window or check a message, but they do not start a new task. | Working memory begins to decay. Nielsen's 10-second limit marks the point where attention starts to wander;[^nielsen-1993] beyond it, each additional second increases the chance of distraction (extrapolated from the same perceptual thresholds). |
| **2 to 10 minutes** | The developer context-switches. They check email, review a PR, or start thinking about a different problem. When the result arrives, they must actively return to the original task. | Working memory is partially lost. Rebuilding context takes several minutes depending on the complexity of the change.[^mark-2008] |
| **Over 10 minutes** | The developer fully disengages and starts a different task. The test result arrives as an interruption to whatever they are now doing. | Working memory of the original change is gone. Rebuilding it takes upward of 23 minutes.[^mark-2008] Investigating a failure means re-reading code they wrote an hour ago. |

The conventional 10-minute CI target lines up with the boundary between "developer waits and acts
on the result" and "developer starts something else and pays a full context-switch penalty."
Below 10 minutes, feedback is actionable. Above 10 minutes, feedback becomes an interruption. The
number itself is an established CD convention rather than a figure the cognitive research
produces directly, but DORA's research on
continuous integration converges on the same target: tests should complete in under 10 minutes to
support the fast feedback loops that high-performing teams depend on.[^dora-ci]

## What this means for test architecture

These cognitive breakpoints should drive how you structure your test suite:

**Local development (under 1 second).** Unit tests for the code you are actively changing should
run in watch mode, re-executing on every save. At this speed, TDD becomes natural - the test
result is part of the writing process, not a separate step. This is where you test complex logic
with many permutations.

**Pre-push verification (under 2 minutes).** The full unit test suite and the component tests
for the component you changed should complete before you push. At this speed, the developer
stays engaged and acts on failures immediately. This is where you catch regressions.

**CI pipeline (under 10 minutes).** The full deterministic suite - all unit tests, all component
tests, all contract tests - should complete within 10 minutes of commit. At this speed, the
developer has not yet fully disengaged from the change. If CI fails, they can investigate while
the code is still fresh.

**Post-deploy verification (minutes to hours).** E2E smoke tests and integration test validation
run after deployment. These are non-deterministic, slower, and less frequent. Failures at this
level trigger investigation, not immediate developer action.

When a test suite exceeds 10 minutes, the solution is not to accept slower feedback. It is to
redesign the suite: replace E2E tests with component tests using test doubles, parallelize test
execution, and move non-deterministic tests out of the gating path.

## Impact on application architecture

Test feedback speed is not just a testing concern - it puts pressure on how you design your
systems. A monolithic application with a single test suite that takes 40 minutes to run forces
every developer to pay the full context-switch penalty on every change, regardless of which
module they touched.

Breaking a system into smaller, independently testable components is often motivated as much by
test speed as by deployment independence. When a component has its own focused test suite that
runs in under 2 minutes, the developer working on that component gets fast, relevant feedback.
They do not wait for tests in unrelated modules to finish.

This creates a virtuous cycle: smaller components with clear boundaries produce faster test
suites, which enable more frequent integration, which encourages smaller changes, which are
easier to test. Conversely, a tightly coupled monolith produces a slow, tangled test suite that
discourages frequent integration, which leads to larger changes, which are harder to test and
more likely to fail.

Architecture decisions that improve test feedback speed include:

- **Clear component boundaries** with well-defined interfaces, so each component can be tested
  in isolation with test doubles for its dependencies.
- **Separating business logic from infrastructure** so that core rules can be unit tested in
  milliseconds without databases, queues, or network calls.
- **Independently deployable services** with their own test suites, so a change to one service
  does not require running the entire system's tests.
- **Avoiding shared mutable state** between components, which forces integration tests and
  introduces non-determinism.

If your test suite is slow and you cannot make it faster by optimizing test execution alone, the
architecture is telling you something. A system that is hard to test quickly is also hard to
change safely - and both problems have the same root cause.

## The compounding cost of slow feedback

Slow feedback does not just waste time - it changes behavior. When the suite takes 40 minutes,
developers adapt:

- They batch changes to avoid running the suite more than necessary, creating larger and riskier
  commits.
- They stop running tests locally because the wait is unacceptable during active development.
- They push to CI and context-switch, paying the full rebuild penalty on every cycle.
- They rerun failures instead of investigating, because re-reading the code they wrote an hour
  ago is expensive enough that "maybe it was flaky" feels like a reasonable bet.

Each of these behaviors degrades quality independently. Together, they make continuous integration
impossible. A team that cannot get feedback on a change within 10 minutes cannot sustain the
practice of integrating changes multiple times per day.[^forsgren-2018]
