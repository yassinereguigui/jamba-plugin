  An API provider that also consumes one or more upstream APIs. The most failure-prone pattern in distributed systems and the one that gets the most testing attention.
---

Same as API provider, plus outbound HTTP/gRPC calls to services the team does not own (or does own but deploys independently). This is the most failure-prone pattern in distributed systems and gets the most testing attention.

## What needs covered

Everything from the API provider pattern, plus:

| Layer | Concern | Test type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Outbound HTTP client | Request shape, response parsing, status code handling, header propagation, timeout enforcement | Adapter integration tests (against WireMock or, periodically, the real downstream) |
| Consumed API contract | The fields and status codes the consumer depends on | Consumer-side contract tests |
| Resilience under degraded dependencies | Retries, circuit breaking, backoff, fallback, partial-failure compensation | Component tests with fault-injecting client doubles |
| Composite behavior | The service still returns useful responses when downstreams misbehave | Component tests |

## Positive test cases

Common cases to consider, not an exhaustive list. Drop items that don't apply and add ones the pattern doesn't mention but your component needs.

- **Outbound call**: constructs the right URL, headers, body, auth, and timeout.
- **Success response**: parsed correctly, including optional fields and unknown fields per Postel's Law.
- **Multi-call composition**: multiple downstream calls in sequence or parallel produce the documented composite response.
- **Caching**: returns the cached value within TTL and refreshes after.
- **Trace context**: propagates downstream.

## Negative test cases

Common cases to consider, not an exhaustive list. The bulk of the negative testing happens here, and it's where most production incidents originate. Drive each failure mode through a client double that simulates it.

- **Timeout** (downstream exceeds configured deadline): the deadline enforces; the upstream caller gets the documented response (e.g., 504); no partial state is committed. Use a client double that delays past the deadline.
- **Connection refused**: retry policy executes the documented count and backoff; falls over to fallback or returns an error. Use a client double that rejects the connection.
- **5xx responses** (500, 502, 503): retry only on retryable codes. Use a client double that returns 5xx.
- **4xx responses** (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 429): each maps to documented behavior; 4xx generally not retried; 429 respects `Retry-After`. Use a client double that returns each code.
- **Slow response within timeout**: performance-budget assertions hold if the service has SLO commitments. Use a client double that delays within the deadline.
- **Malformed response body**: the response is rejected, not silently coerced. Use a client double that returns a truncated or wrong-type body.
- **Schema drift** (extra or missing fields): extra fields tolerated; missing required fields detected with a clear error. Use a client double that returns a drifted body.
- **Wrong status code** (200 with error body, 500 with success body): the client trusts the status code, not the body. Use a client double that returns mismatched status and body.
- **Circuit open**: the circuit opens under sustained failure; fast-fails subsequent calls; recovers on a half-open probe. Use a client double that sustains failures.
- **Partial multi-call failure**: compensation, rollback, or documented partial-success behavior. First client double succeeds, second fails.

## Test double validation

This is where the "doubles need tests" rule lives or dies. Four layers:

1. **Consumer-side contract tests** run in the pipeline on every commit using doubles. They pin the request the consumer sends and the response shape the consumer depends on. Contract artifacts are published to a broker. Fast, deterministic, blocks the build.
2. **Adapter integration tests** exercise the outbound HTTP client against the real dependency in a controlled state - typically a testcontainer running an in-house service the team owns. They verify the adapter code correctly speaks the protocol: serialization, deserialization, header handling, timeout behavior, error mapping. The test asserts the *adapter*'s correctness, not the dependency's behavior: if the test asks for a user, it validates that the response parses into a valid `User`, not which user was returned. For third-party dependencies the team can't run in a controlled state, run these tests out-of-band on a schedule. WireMock loaded with provider-supplied fixtures is a useful complement but functions more like a contract test against recorded shapes than an integration test against the live protocol.
3. **Provider-side contract verification** runs in the *provider's* pipeline. The provider executes every consumer's published contract against the real provider implementation. Breaking changes are caught at the source before the provider deploys.
4. **Post-deploy integration check** runs periodically against the real downstream in a non-production environment. Same fixtures used in contract tests. Catches drift in fields the contract didn't pin, version skew, environment differences. Failures trigger review, not a build break. See Out-of-Pipeline Verification.

For **third-party APIs** you do not control, there is no provider verification step. The post-deploy check against the live (or sandbox) API is the only mechanism keeping doubles honest. Run it more often than for in-house dependencies. Daily at minimum.

The anti-pattern to avoid: stubbing the third-party SDK directly. Always wrap third-party clients in a thin adapter the team owns, then double the adapter. This is called out explicitly as Mocking what you don't own and is the single most common source of "but it worked in tests" incidents.

## Pipeline placement

Same as the API provider pattern, plus:

- Consumer-side contract tests: pre-commit and CI Stage 1.
- Adapter integration tests for the outbound HTTP client against an in-house dependency the team controls (a testcontainer running the team's own service in a known state): CI Stage 1 or Stage 2.
- Adapter integration tests against a third-party API or a service owned by another team: out-of-band on a schedule, never in-band. The risk of a flaky external service blocking deploys outweighs any in-band coverage benefit, and adapter tests with WireMock fixtures already cover the team's adapter code.
- Resilience component tests with fault injection: CI Stage 1.
- Post-deploy integration checks against real downstreams: out of pipeline, on a schedule.

## Example: fault injection at the client double

A negative-path test for downstream timeout. The payment client double simulates a slow response, the test asserts the deadline enforces and the upstream caller gets the documented error envelope:

@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
class PaymentTimeoutTest {

  @Autowired MockMvc mvc;
  @Autowired InMemoryOrderRepo orderRepo;
  @MockBean PaymentsGateway payments;

  @Test
  void returns_504_when_payment_service_exceeds_deadline() throws Exception {
    when(payments.charge(any())).thenAnswer(inv -> {
      Thread.sleep(50);
      throw new UpstreamTimeoutException("payments");
    });

    var body = """
      { "items": [{"sku": "A1", "qty": 1}], "paymentToken": "pm_ok" }
      """;

    mvc.perform(post("/orders")
        .header("Authorization", "Bearer tok_valid")
        .contentType(APPLICATION_JSON)
        .content(body))
      .andExpect(status().isGatewayTimeout())
      .andExpect(jsonPath("$.error.code").value("UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT"));

    assertThat(orderRepo.all()).isEmpty();
  }
}

public class PaymentTimeoutTests : IClassFixture<WebApplicationFactory<Program>>
{
    private readonly HttpClient client;
    private readonly InMemoryOrderRepo orderRepo = new();
    private readonly Mock<IPaymentsGateway> payments = new();

    public PaymentTimeoutTests(WebApplicationFactory<Program> factory)
    {
        payments.Setup(p => p.ChargeAsync(It.IsAny<ChargeRequest>()))
            .Returns(async () =>
            {
                await Task.Delay(50);
                throw new UpstreamTimeoutException("payments");
            });

        client = factory.WithWebHostBuilder(b => b.ConfigureServices(s =>
        {
            s.AddSingleton<IOrderRepo>(orderRepo);
            s.AddSingleton(payments.Object);
        })).CreateClient();
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task Returns_504_when_payment_service_exceeds_deadline()
    {
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new("Bearer", "tok_valid");
        var body = new { items = new[] { new { sku = "A1", qty = 1 } }, paymentToken = "pm_ok" };

        var response = await client.PostAsJsonAsync("/orders", body);

        response.StatusCode.Should().Be(HttpStatusCode.GatewayTimeout);
        var error = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<ErrorEnvelope>();
        error!.Error.Code.Should().Be("UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT");
        orderRepo.All().Should().BeEmpty();
    }
}

test("returns 504 when payment service exceeds deadline", async () => {
  const slowPayments = {
    charge: () => new Promise((_, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => reject(new TimeoutError("payments")), 50);
    })
  };
  const orderRepo = new InMemoryOrderRepo();
  const app = buildApp({ orderRepo, payments: slowPayments, deadlineMs: 30 });

  const res = await request(app)
    .post("/orders")
    .set("Authorization", "Bearer tok_valid")
    .send({ items: [{ sku: "A1", qty: 1 }], paymentToken: "pm_ok" });

  expect(res.status).toBe(504);
  expect(res.body.error.code).toBe("UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT");
  expect(orderRepo.all()).toHaveLength(0);
});

The test verifies three things at once: the documented status code, the structured error body the API contract promises, and that no partial state was committed.
