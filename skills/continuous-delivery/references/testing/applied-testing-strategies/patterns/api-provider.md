A backend service that exposes an HTTP/gRPC/GraphQL API and owns its own data. No outbound calls to other services in your control.

## What needs covered

| Layer | Concern | Test type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain logic | Business rules, invariants, state transitions | Solitary unit tests |
| Module collaboration | Validators + repositories + domain working together | Sociable unit tests |
| Persistence adapter | Query correctness, transaction boundaries, migrations against the real DB engine | Adapter integration tests (testcontainers running production engine and version) |
| Assembled component | Routing, validation, business logic, and persistence wired together through the controller layer | Component tests with persistence either real (testcontainers) or doubled (in-memory repository) |
| Served API | What downstream consumers depend on | Provider-side contract tests |

## Positive test cases

Common cases to consider, not an exhaustive list. Drop items that don't apply and add ones the pattern doesn't mention but your component needs.

- **Documented endpoints**: return the expected shape and status for valid input.
- **Auth**: succeeds for valid credentials and tokens.
- **Pagination, filtering, sorting**: all return the documented results.
- **Idempotency**: idempotent operations are idempotent; non-idempotent operations create exactly one record.
- **Success-path side effects**: events emitted and audit log entries happen on the success path.

## Negative test cases

Common cases to consider, not an exhaustive list. Drop items that don't apply and add ones the pattern doesn't mention but your component needs.

- **Malformed body**: bad JSON, missing required fields, wrong types, extra fields handled per the documented policy (reject vs. ignore).
- **Out-of-range values**: negatives where positives are expected, oversize strings, unicode edge cases.
- **Auth failures**: missing token, expired token, valid token with insufficient scope, valid token for a different tenant.
- **Authorization boundaries**: user A cannot read or modify user B's resources.
- **Resource not found**: referenced IDs don't exist, return 404 not 500.
- **Concurrency**: two writes to the same resource at once, optimistic-lock conflict handled with the documented status code.
- **Persistence failure**: DB unavailable, deadlock, constraint violation. The error envelope is correct and no partial state is committed.
- **Rate limiting and request size limits**: both enforce as documented.
- **Idempotency under retry**: same idempotency key within the window returns the original result, not a duplicate write.

## Test double validation

Doubles in this pattern are mostly around persistence. Two layers keep them honest:

1. **Adapter integration tests run against a real instance of your production database engine** (the same major version, same extensions). If component tests use an in-memory SQLite shim while production runs Postgres, the shim is the lie. The adapter integration test exercises every query and migration against a Postgres testcontainer in CI.
2. **Provider-side contract tests** verify the API still satisfies every published consumer expectation. See Consumer and Provider Perspectives. Provider verification is where you discover that a "harmless" field rename broke a consumer before that consumer deploys.

## Pipeline placement

- Unit + sociable unit tests: pre-commit and CI Stage 1.
- Adapter integration tests against testcontainers: CI Stage 1 if fast, Stage 2 otherwise.
- Component tests: CI Stage 1.
- Provider-side contract verification: CD Stage 1 (Contract and Boundary Validation).

## Example: component test

A flow-oriented component test for an order-placement endpoint. The full app is assembled with an in-memory order repository and an in-memory event bus. The test drives the assembled component through its HTTP handlers and asserts on observable outcomes (status, persisted state, emitted event):

```java
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
class OrderPlacementTest {

  @Autowired MockMvc mvc;
  @Autowired InMemoryOrderRepo orderRepo;
  @Autowired InMemoryEventBus events;

  @Test
  void places_order_with_valid_payment_creates_order_and_emits_OrderPlaced() throws Exception {
    var body = """
      { "items": [{"sku": "A1", "qty": 2}], "paymentToken": "pm_ok" }
      """;

    var result = mvc.perform(post("/orders")
        .header("Authorization", "Bearer tok_valid")
        .contentType(APPLICATION_JSON)
        .content(body))
      .andExpect(status().isCreated())
      .andReturn();

    var orderId = JsonPath.<String>read(result.getResponse().getContentAsString(), "$.id");
    assertThat(orderRepo.findById(orderId)).isPresent();
    assertThat(events.published()).anyMatch(e ->
        e.type().equals("OrderPlaced") && e.orderId().equals(orderId));
  }
}
```

```csharp
public class OrderPlacementTests : IClassFixture<WebApplicationFactory<Program>>
{
    private readonly HttpClient client;
    private readonly InMemoryOrderRepo orderRepo = new();
    private readonly InMemoryEventBus events = new();

    public OrderPlacementTests(WebApplicationFactory<Program> factory)
    {
        client = factory.WithWebHostBuilder(b => b.ConfigureServices(s =>
        {
            s.AddSingleton<IOrderRepo>(orderRepo);
            s.AddSingleton<IEventBus>(events);
        })).CreateClient();
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task Places_order_with_valid_payment_creates_order_and_emits_OrderPlaced()
    {
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new("Bearer", "tok_valid");
        var body = new { items = new[] { new { sku = "A1", qty = 2 } }, paymentToken = "pm_ok" };

        var response = await client.PostAsJsonAsync("/orders", body);

        response.StatusCode.Should().Be(HttpStatusCode.Created);
        var created = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<OrderCreated>();
        orderRepo.FindById(created!.Id).Should().NotBeNull();
        events.Published.Should().Contain(e =>
            e.Type == "OrderPlaced" && e.OrderId == created.Id);
    }
}
```

```javascript
import request from "supertest";
import { buildApp } from "./app.js";
import { InMemoryOrderRepo } from "./test/in-memory-order-repo.js";
import { InMemoryEventBus } from "./test/in-memory-event-bus.js";

test("places order with valid payment creates order and emits OrderPlaced", async () => {
  const orderRepo = new InMemoryOrderRepo();
  const events = new InMemoryEventBus();
  const app = buildApp({ orderRepo, events });

  const res = await request(app)
    .post("/orders")
    .set("Authorization", "Bearer tok_valid")
    .send({ items: [{ sku: "A1", qty: 2 }], paymentToken: "pm_ok" });

  expect(res.status).toBe(201);
  expect(orderRepo.findById(res.body.id)).toBeDefined();
  expect(events.published).toContainEqual(
    expect.objectContaining({ type: "OrderPlaced", orderId: res.body.id })
  );
});
```

The test asserts on what a real caller can observe, not on private methods or call sequences inside the controller.
