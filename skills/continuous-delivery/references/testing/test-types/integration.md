  Tests that exercise real external dependencies to validate that contract test doubles still match reality. Non-deterministic; never a pre-merge gate.
---

"Integration test" is widely used but inconsistently defined. On this site, **integration
tests** are tests that involve **real external dependencies** - actual databases, live
downstream services, real message brokers, or third-party APIs. They are non-deterministic
because those dependencies introduce timing, state, and availability factors outside the
test's control.

Integration tests serve a specific role in the test architecture: they **validate that the
test doubles used in your
contract tests still match reality**. Without
integration tests, contract test doubles can silently drift from the real behavior of the
systems they simulate - giving false confidence.

Because integration tests depend on live systems, they run **post-deployment** or on a
schedule - never as a pre-merge gate. Failures trigger review or rollback decisions, not
build failures.

For tests that validate interface boundaries using test doubles (deterministic), see
Contract Tests.

For full-system browser tests and multi-service smoke tests, see
End-to-End Tests.

## A note on the word "integration test"

The industry uses "integration test" for at least two different things, and this site keeps them
separate. The page you are reading covers the **out-of-band** flavor: a non-deterministic check
against real external systems that runs on a schedule or post-deploy and never gates the build.

There is also a deterministic, in-band flavor - an
adapter integration test
(Toby Clemson's "gateway integration test"). It exercises a single boundary adapter against a
dependency the team fully controls (typically a per-test testcontainer running the pinned
production engine) and pins the adapter's protocol behavior: serialization, deserialization,
headers, error mapping. Because it is deterministic, it runs in the pre-merge suite and blocks
the build, the same as a unit or contract test. When the dependency is *not* team-controlled - a
third-party API, a shared environment - that same adapter test runs out-of-band, as described on
this page.

So "integration test," unqualified, is ambiguous on this site. When a page means the in-band
adapter flavor, it says
adapter integration test; when
it means the out-of-band check, it links here.
