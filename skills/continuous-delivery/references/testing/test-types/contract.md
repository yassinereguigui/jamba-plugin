  Deterministic tests that verify interface boundaries with external systems using test doubles. Also called narrow integration tests. Validated by integration tests running against real systems.
---

## Definition

A contract test (also called a **narrow integration test**) is a deterministic test that
validates your code's interaction with an external system's interface using
test doubles. It verifies that the boundary
layer code - HTTP clients, database query layers, message producers - correctly handles
the expected request/response shapes, field names, types, and status codes.

A contract test validates **interface structure, not business behavior**. It answers
"does my code correctly interact with the interface I expect?" not "is the logic correct?"
Business logic belongs in component tests.

Because contract tests use test doubles rather than live systems, they are
**deterministic** and run on every commit as part of the pipeline. They block the build
on failure, just like unit and component tests.

Integration tests validate that contract
test doubles still match the real external systems by running against live dependencies
post-deployment.

## Consumer and Provider Perspectives

Every contract has two sides. The questions each side is trying to answer are different.

### Consumer contract testing

The **consumer** is the service or component that depends on an external API. A consumer
contract test asks:

> **"Do the fields I depend on still exist, in the types I expect, with the status codes
> I handle?"**

Consumer tests assert only on the **subset of the API the consumer actually uses** - not
everything the provider exposes. A consumer that only needs `id` and `email` from a user
object should not assert on `address` or `phone`. This allows providers to add new fields
freely without breaking consumers.

Following Postel's Law - "be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept"

- consumer tests should accept any valid response that contains the fields they need, and
tolerate fields they do not use.

What a consumer is trying to discover:

- Has the provider changed or removed a field I depend on?
- Has the provider changed a type I expect (string to integer, object to array)?
- Has the provider changed a status code I handle?
- Does the provider still accept the request format I send?

### Provider contract testing

The **provider** is the service that owns the API. A provider contract test asks:

> **"Have my changes broken any of my consumers?"**

A provider runs contract tests to verify that its API responses still satisfy the
expectations of every known consumer. This gives early warning - before any consumer
deploys and discovers the breakage - that a change is breaking.

What a provider is trying to discover:

- Have I removed or renamed a field that a consumer depends on?
- Have I changed a type in a way that breaks deserialization for a consumer?
- Have I changed error behavior (status codes, error formats) that consumers handle?
- Is my API still backward compatible with all published consumer expectations?

## Approaches to Contract Testing

### Consumer-driven contract development

In **consumer-driven contracts (CDC)**, the consumer writes the contract. The consumer
defines their expectations as executable tests - what request they will send and what
response shape they require. These expectations are published to a shared contract broker and the provider runs them
as part of their own build.

The flow:

1. Consumer team writes tests defining their expectations against a mock provider.
2. The consumer tests generate a contract artifact.
3. The contract is published to a shared contract broker.
4. The provider team runs the consumer's contract expectations against their real
   implementation.
5. If the provider's implementation satisfies the contract, the provider can deploy
   with confidence it will not break this consumer. If not, the teams negotiate before
   merging the breaking change.

CDC works well for **evolving systems**: it grounds the API design in actual consumer
needs rather than the provider's assumptions about what consumers will use.

### Contract-first development

In **contract-first development**, the interface is defined as a formal artifact -
an OpenAPI specification, a Protobuf schema, an Avro schema, or similar - before
any implementation is written. Both the consumer and provider code are generated from
or validated against that artifact.

The flow:

1. Teams agree on the interface contract (usually during design or story refinement).
2. The contract is committed to version control.
3. Consumer and provider teams develop independently, each generating or validating
   their code against the contract.
4. Tests on both sides verify conformance to the contract - not to each other's
   implementation.

Contract-first works well for **new APIs and parallel development**: it lets consumer
and provider teams work simultaneously without waiting for a real implementation, and
makes the interface an explicit design decision rather than an emergent one.

### Choosing between them

| Situation | Prefer |
|-----------|--------|
| Existing API with multiple consumers, evolving over time | Consumer-driven (CDC) |
| New API, teams working in parallel | Contract-first |
| Third-party API you do not control | Consumer-only contract tests (no provider side) |
| Public API with external consumers you cannot reach | Provider tests against published spec |

The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. A team may define an initial contract-first
schema and then adopt CDC tooling as the number of consumers grows.

## Characteristics

| Property        | Value                                             |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Speed**       | Milliseconds to seconds                           |
| **Determinism** | Always deterministic (uses test doubles)          |
| **Scope**       | Interface boundary between two systems            |
| **Dependencies**| All replaced with test doubles                    |
| **Network**     | None or localhost only                            |
| **Database**    | None                                              |
| **Breaks build**| Yes                                               |

## Examples

A consumer contract test using a consumer-driven contract tool:

```javascript
describe("Order Service - Inventory Provider Contract", () => {
  it("should receive stock availability in the expected format", async () => {
    // Define what the consumer expects from the provider
    await contractTool.addInteraction({
      state: "item-42 is in stock",
      uponReceiving: "a request for item-42 stock",
      withRequest: { method: "GET", path: "/stock/item-42" },
      willRespondWith: {
        status: 200,
        body: {
          // Only assert on fields the consumer actually uses
          available: matchType(true),   // boolean
          quantity: matchType(10),      // integer
        },
      },
    });

    // Exercise the consumer code against the mock provider
    const result = await inventoryClient.checkStock("item-42");
    expect(result.available).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

A provider verification test that runs consumer expectations against the real implementation:

```javascript
describe("Inventory Service - Provider Verification", () => {
  it("should satisfy all registered consumer contracts", async () => {
    await contractBroker.verifyProvider({
      provider: "InventoryService",
      providerBaseUrl: "http://localhost:3001",
      brokerUrl: "https://contract-broker.internal",
      providerVersion: process.env.GIT_SHA,
    });
  });
});
```

A contract-first schema validation test verifying a provider response against an OpenAPI spec:

```javascript
// The OpenAPI document is the source of truth. Validate the whole response
// against the named schema rather than hand-checking individual fields - a
// field-by-field check drifts from the spec the moment the spec changes.
const validator = openApiValidator(openApiSpec);

describe("GET /stock/:id - OpenAPI contract", () => {
  it("should return a response conforming to the published schema", async () => {
    const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3001/stock/item-42");
    const body = await response.json();

    expect(response.status).toBe(200);

    // Asserts structure, types, required fields, and additionalProperties
    // rules exactly as the OpenAPI schema declares them.
    const result = validator.validate(body, "StockResponse");
    expect(result.errors).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Asserting on business logic**: contract tests verify structure, not behavior. A contract
  test that asserts `quantity > 0` when in stock is crossing into business logic territory.
  That belongs in component tests.
- **Asserting on fields the consumer does not use**: over-specified consumer contracts make
  providers brittle. Only assert on what your code actually reads.
- **Testing specific data values**: asserting that `name` equals `"Alice"` makes the test
  brittle. Assert on types, required fields, and status codes instead.
- **Hitting live systems in contract tests**: contract tests must use test doubles to stay
  deterministic. Validating doubles against live systems is the role of
  integration tests, which run post-deployment.
- **Running infrequently**: contract tests should run often enough to catch drift before it
  causes a production incident. High-volatility APIs may need hourly runs.
- **Skipping provider verification in CDC**: publishing consumer expectations is only half
  the pattern. The provider must actually run those expectations for CDC to work.

## Connection to CD Pipeline

Contract tests run **on every commit** as part of the deterministic pipeline:

```text
On every commit          Unit tests              Deterministic    Blocks
                         Component tests         Deterministic    Blocks
                         Contract tests          Deterministic    Blocks

Post-deployment          Integration tests       Non-deterministic   Validates contract doubles
                         E2E smoke tests         Non-deterministic   Triggers rollback
```

Contract tests verify that your boundary layer code correctly interacts with the
interfaces you depend on. Integration tests
validate that those test doubles still match the real external systems by running
against live dependencies post-deployment.
