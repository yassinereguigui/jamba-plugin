  What tests run where in a CD pipeline, how contract tests validate the test doubles used inside the pipeline, and why everything that blocks deployment must be deterministic.
---

**Everything that blocks deployment must be deterministic and under your control.** Everything
that involves external systems runs asynchronously or post-deployment. This gives you the
independence to deploy any time, regardless of the state of the world around you.

## Tests Inside the Pipeline

These tests run on every commit and **block deployment if they fail**. They must be fast,
deterministic, and free of external dependencies.

Every test in this pipeline uses test doubles for
anything that crosses the component boundary into a system the team does not control: third-party
APIs, downstream services owned by other teams, message brokers. No in-band test calls a shared
or external service. A real engine the team owns and isolates per test - a database in a per-test
testcontainer, for example - is permitted in-band because it stays deterministic. This means:

- **A downstream outage cannot block your deployment.** Your pipeline runs the same whether
  external systems are healthy or down.
- **Tests are deterministic.** The same code always produces the same result.
- **The suite is fast.** No network latency, no waiting for external systems to respond.

### Why re-run tests post-merge?

Two changes can each pass pre-merge independently but conflict when combined on trunk. The
post-merge run catches these integration effects. If a post-merge failure occurs, the team
fixes it immediately. Trunk must always be releasable.

## Tests Outside the Pipeline

These tests involve real external systems and are therefore **non-deterministic**. They never
block deployment. Instead, they validate assumptions and monitor production health.

| Test Type | When It Runs | What It Does on Failure |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Contract tests** | On a schedule (hourly or daily) | Triggers review; team updates test doubles to match new reality |
| **E2E smoke tests** | After each deployment | Triggers rollback if critical path is broken |
| **Synthetic monitoring** | Continuously in production | Triggers alerts for operations |

## How Contract Tests Validate Test Doubles

The pipeline's deterministic tests depend on test doubles to represent external systems. But
test doubles can drift from reality. An API adds a required field, changes a response format,
or deprecates an endpoint. Contract tests close this gap.

1. **Pipeline tests use test doubles** that encode your assumptions about external APIs -
   response schemas, status codes, error formats.
2. **Contract tests run on a schedule** and send real requests to the actual external APIs.
3. **Contract tests compare the real response** against what your test doubles return. They
   check structure and types, not specific data values.
4. **When a contract test passes**, your test doubles are confirmed accurate. The pipeline's
   deterministic tests are trustworthy.
5. **When a contract test fails**, the team is alerted. They update the test doubles to match
   the new reality, then re-run component tests to verify nothing breaks.

This design means your pipeline never touches external systems, but you still catch when
external systems change. You get both speed and accuracy.

### Consumer-driven contracts

When the external API is owned by another team in your organization, you can go further with
**consumer-driven contracts**. Instead of your team polling their API on a schedule, both teams
share a contract specification (using a tool like [Pact](https://pact.io/)):

- **You (the consumer)** define the requests you send and the responses you expect.
- **They (the provider)** run your contract as part of their build. If a change would break
  your expectations, their build fails before they deploy.
- **Your test doubles are generated from the contract**, guaranteeing they match what the
  provider actually delivers.

This shifts contract validation from "detect and react" to "prevent." See
Contract Tests for implementation details.

## Summary: All Stages at a Glance

| Stage | Blocks Deployment? | Uses Test Doubles? | Deterministic? |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Every Commit | Yes | Yes - all external deps | Yes |
| Post-Merge | Yes | Yes - all external deps | Yes |
| Scheduled (Contract) | No - triggers review | No - hits real APIs | No |
| Post-Deploy (E2E) | No - triggers rollback | No - real system | No |
| Production (Monitoring) | No - triggers alerts | No - real system | No |
