  The capability to deploy any change to production at any time, using the delivery strategy that fits your context.
---

**Key question:** "Can we deliver any change to production when the business needs it?"

This is the destination: you can deploy any change that passes the pipeline to production
whenever you choose. Some teams will auto-deploy every commit (continuous deployment). Others
will deploy on demand when the business is ready. Both are valid - the capability is what
matters, not the trigger.

## What You'll Do

1. **Deploy on demand** - Remove the last manual gates so any green build can reach production
2. **Use progressive rollout** - Canary, blue-green, and percentage-based deployments
3. **Explore ACD** - AI-assisted continuous delivery patterns
4. **Learn from experience reports** - How other teams made the journey

## Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment

These terms are often confused. The distinction matters for this phase:

- **Continuous delivery** means every commit that passes the pipeline *could* be deployed to
  production at any time. The capability exists. A human or business process decides when.
- **Continuous deployment** means every commit that passes the pipeline *is* deployed to
  production automatically. No human decision is involved.

Continuous delivery is the goal of this migration guide. Continuous deployment is one delivery
strategy that works well for certain contexts - SaaS products, internal tools, services behind
feature flags. It is not a higher level of maturity. A team that deploys on demand with a
one-click deploy is just as capable as a team that auto-deploys every commit.

## Why This Phase Matters

When your foundations are solid, your pipeline is reliable, and your batch sizes are small,
deploying any change becomes low-risk. The remaining barriers are organizational, not
technical: approval processes, change windows, release coordination. This phase addresses those
barriers so the team has the *option* to deploy whenever the business needs it.

## Signs You've Arrived

- Any commit that passes the pipeline can reach production within minutes
- The team deploys frequently (daily or more) with no drama
- Mean time to recovery is measured in minutes
- The team has confidence that any deployment can be safely rolled back
- New team members can deploy on their first day
- The deployment strategy (on-demand or automatic) is a team choice, not a constraint
