**Phase 3 - Optimize** |  | Original content based on Dojo Consortium delivery journey patterns

You cannot deploy independently if your architecture requires coordinated releases. This page describes the three architecture states teams encounter on the journey to continuous deployment and provides practical strategies for moving from entangled to loosely coupled.

## Why Architecture Matters for CD

Every practice in this guide - small batches, feature flags, WIP limits - assumes that your team can deploy its changes independently. But if your application is a monolith where changing one module requires retesting everything, or a set of microservices with tightly coupled APIs, independent deployment is impossible regardless of how good your practices are.

Architecture is either an enabler or a blocker for continuous deployment. There is no neutral.

## Three Architecture States

The Delivery System Improvement Journey describes three states that teams move through. Most teams start entangled. The goal is to reach loosely coupled.

### State 1: Entangled

In an entangled architecture, everything is connected to everything. Changes in one area routinely break other areas. Teams cannot deploy independently.

**Characteristics:**

- Shared database schemas with no ownership boundaries
- Circular dependencies between modules or services
- Deploying one service requires deploying three others at the same time
- Integration testing requires the entire system to be running
- A single team's change can block every other team's release
- "Big bang" releases on a fixed schedule

**Impact on delivery:**

| Metric | Typical State |
|--------|--------------|
| Deployment frequency | Monthly or quarterly (because coordinating releases is hard) |
| Lead time | Weeks to months (because changes wait for the next release train) |
| Change failure rate | High (because big releases mean big risk) |
| MTTR | Long (because failures cascade across boundaries) |

**How you got here:** Entanglement is the natural result of building quickly without deliberate architectural boundaries. It is not a failure - it is a stage that almost every system passes through.

### State 2: Tightly Coupled

In a tightly coupled architecture, there are identifiable boundaries between components, but those boundaries are leaky. Teams have some independence, but coordination is still required for many changes.

**Characteristics:**

- Services exist but share a database or use synchronous point-to-point calls
- API contracts exist but are not versioned - breaking changes require simultaneous updates
- Teams can deploy some changes independently, but cross-cutting changes require coordination
- Integration testing requires multiple services but not the entire system
- Release trains still exist but are smaller and more frequent

**Impact on delivery:**

| Metric | Typical State |
|--------|--------------|
| Deployment frequency | Weekly to bi-weekly |
| Lead time | Days to a week |
| Change failure rate | Moderate (improving but still affected by coupling) |
| MTTR | Hours (failures are more isolated but still cascade sometimes) |

### State 3: Loosely Coupled

In a loosely coupled architecture, components communicate through well-defined interfaces, own their own data, and can be deployed independently without coordinating with other teams.

**Characteristics:**

- Each service owns its own data store - no shared databases
- APIs are versioned; consumers and producers can be updated independently
- Asynchronous communication (events, queues) is used where possible
- Each team can deploy without coordinating with any other team
- Services are designed to degrade gracefully if a dependency is unavailable
- No release trains - each team deploys when ready

**Impact on delivery:**

| Metric | Typical State |
|--------|--------------|
| Deployment frequency | On-demand (multiple times per day) |
| Lead time | Hours |
| Change failure rate | Low (small, isolated changes) |
| MTTR | Minutes (failures are contained within service boundaries) |

## Moving from Entangled to Tightly Coupled

This is the first and most difficult transition. It requires establishing boundaries where none existed before.

### Strategy 1: Identify Natural Seams

Look for places where the system already has natural boundaries, even if they are not enforced:

- **Different business domains:** Orders, payments, inventory, and user accounts are different domains even if they live in the same codebase.
- **Different rates of change:** Code that changes weekly and code that changes yearly should not be in the same deployment unit.
- **Different scaling needs:** Components with different load profiles benefit from separate deployment.
- **Different team ownership:** If different teams work on different parts of the codebase, those parts are candidates for separation.

### Strategy 2: Strangler Fig Pattern

Instead of rewriting the system, incrementally extract components from the monolith.

Step 1: Route all traffic through a facade/proxy
Step 2: Build the new component alongside the old
Step 3: Route a small percentage of traffic to the new component
Step 4: Validate correctness and performance
Step 5: Route all traffic to the new component
Step 6: Remove the old code

**Key rule:** The strangler fig pattern must be done incrementally. If you try to extract everything at once, you are doing a rewrite, not a strangler fig.

### Strategy 3: Define Ownership Boundaries

Assign clear ownership of each module or component to a single team. Ownership means:

- The owning team decides the API contract
- The owning team deploys the component
- Other teams consume the API, not the internal implementation
- Changes to the API contract require agreement from consumers (but not simultaneous deployment)

### What to Avoid

- **The "big rewrite":** Rewriting a monolith from scratch almost always fails. Use the strangler fig pattern instead.
- **Premature microservices:** Do not split into microservices until you have clear domain boundaries and team ownership. Microservices with unclear boundaries are a distributed monolith - the worst of both worlds.
- **Shared databases across services:** This is the most common coupling mechanism. If two services share a database, they cannot be deployed independently because a schema change in one service can break the other.

## Moving from Tightly Coupled to Loosely Coupled

This transition is about hardening the boundaries that were established in the previous step.

### Strategy 1: Eliminate Shared Data Stores

If two services share a database, one of three things needs to happen:

1. **One service owns the data, the other calls its API.** The dependent service no longer accesses the database directly.
2. **The data is duplicated.** Each service maintains its own copy, synchronized via events.
3. **The shared data becomes a dedicated data service.** Both services consume from a service that owns the data.

BEFORE (shared database):
  Service A → [Shared DB] ← Service B

AFTER (option 1 - API ownership):
  Service A → [DB A]
  Service B → Service A API → [DB A]

AFTER (option 2 - event-driven duplication):
  Service A → [DB A] → Events → Service B → [DB B]

AFTER (option 3 - data service):
  Service A → Data Service → [DB]
  Service B → Data Service → [DB]

### Strategy 2: Version Your APIs

API versioning allows consumers and producers to evolve independently.

**Rules for API versioning:**

- **Never make a breaking change without a new version.** Adding fields is non-breaking. Removing fields is breaking. Changing field types is breaking.
- **Support at least two versions simultaneously.** This gives consumers time to migrate.
- **Deprecate old versions with a timeline.** "Version 1 will be removed on date X."
- **Use consumer-driven contract tests** to verify compatibility. See Contract Testing.

### Strategy 3: Prefer Asynchronous Communication

Synchronous calls (HTTP, gRPC) create temporal coupling: if the downstream service is slow or unavailable, the upstream service is also affected.

| Communication Style | Coupling | When to Use |
|--------------------|----------|-------------|
| Synchronous (HTTP/gRPC) | Temporal + behavioral | When the caller needs an immediate response |
| Asynchronous (events/queues) | Behavioral only | When the caller does not need an immediate response |
| Event-driven (publish/subscribe) | Minimal | When the producer does not need to know about consumers |

Prefer asynchronous communication wherever the business requirements allow it. Not every interaction needs to be synchronous.

### Strategy 4: Design for Failure

In a loosely coupled system, dependencies will be unavailable sometimes. Design for this:

- **Circuit breakers:** Stop calling a failing dependency after N failures. Return a degraded response instead.
- **Timeouts:** Set aggressive timeouts on all external calls. A 30-second timeout on a service that should respond in 100ms is not a timeout - it is a hang.
- **Bulkheads:** Isolate failures so that one failing dependency does not consume all resources.
- **Graceful degradation:** Define what the user experience should be when a dependency is down. "Recommendations unavailable" is better than a 500 error.

## What Your Team Controls vs. What Requires Broader Change

**Your team controls directly:**

- Identifying coupling points within your service boundary using the strangler fig pattern and
  branch by abstraction
- Defining explicit API contracts for interfaces your team owns and versioning them
- Moving from shared databases to independently owned data stores within your domain
- Introducing event-based communication for new integrations you build

**Requires broader change:**

- **Team structure:** Moving from State 1 (entangled) to State 3 (loosely coupled) at
  organizational scale requires aligning team ownership to domain boundaries. Individual teams
  cannot reorganize themselves - this is a management decision. See
  Team Alignment for how to make that case.
- **Shared infrastructure ownership:** If your team depends on a shared platform or shared
  services team for deployment, storage, or networking, full decoupling requires either
  migrating to self-service infrastructure or renegotiating ownership boundaries with those teams.
- **Legacy integration contracts:** When you own one side of a tightly coupled contract but
  another team owns the other side, migrating to an event-based or versioned API model requires
  coordinated agreement and migration planning with that team.

Start with the decoupling work within your own boundary. Use measured improvements in deployment
frequency and lead time to make the case for the organizational changes.

## Practical Steps for Architecture Decoupling

### Step 1: Map Dependencies

Before changing anything, understand what you have:

1. **Draw a dependency graph.** Which components depend on which? Where are the shared databases?
2. **Identify deployment coupling.** Which components must be deployed together? Why?
3. **Identify the highest-impact coupling.** Which coupling most frequently blocks independent deployment?

### Step 2: Establish the First Boundary

Pick one component to decouple. Choose the one with the highest impact and lowest risk:

1. Apply the strangler fig pattern to extract it
2. Define a clear API contract
3. Move its data to its own data store
4. Deploy it independently

### Step 3: Repeat

Take the next highest-impact coupling and address it. Each decoupling makes the next one easier because the team learns the patterns and the remaining system is simpler.

## Key Pitfalls

### 1. "We need to rewrite everything before we can deploy independently"

No. Decoupling is incremental. Extract one component, deploy it independently, prove the pattern works, then continue. A partial decoupling that enables one team to deploy independently is infinitely more valuable than a planned rewrite that never finishes.

### 2. "We split into microservices but our lead time got worse"

Microservices add operational complexity (more services to deploy, monitor, and debug). If you split without investing in deployment automation, observability, and team autonomy, you will get worse, not better. Microservices are a tool for organizational scaling, not a silver bullet for delivery speed.

### 3. "Teams keep adding new dependencies that recouple the system"

Architecture decoupling requires governance. Establish architectural principles (e.g., "no shared databases") and enforce them through automated checks (e.g., dependency analysis in CI) and architecture reviews for cross-boundary changes.

### 4. "We can't afford the time to decouple"

You cannot afford not to. Every week spent doing coordinated releases is a week of delivery capacity lost to coordination overhead. The investment in decoupling pays for itself quickly through increased deployment frequency and reduced coordination cost.

## Measuring Success

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Teams that can deploy independently | Increasing | The primary measure of decoupling |
| Coordinated releases per quarter | Decreasing toward zero | Confirms coupling is being eliminated |
| Deployment frequency per team | Increasing independently | Confirms teams are not blocked by each other |
| Cross-team dependencies per feature | Decreasing | Confirms architecture supports independent work |

## Next Step

With optimized flow, small batches, metrics-driven improvement, and a decoupled architecture, your team is ready for the final phase. Continue to Phase 4: Deliver on Demand.
