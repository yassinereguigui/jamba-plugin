**Phase 0 - Assess** | 

Before you change anything about how your team delivers software, you need to see how it works
today. Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is the single most effective tool for making your delivery
process visible. It reveals the waiting, the rework, and the handoffs that you have learned to
live with but that are silently destroying your flow.

In the context of a CD migration, a value stream map is not an academic exercise. It is the
foundation for every decision you will make in the phases ahead. It tells you where your time
goes, where quality breaks down, and which constraint to attack first.

## What Is a Value Stream Map?

A value stream map is a visual representation of every step required to deliver a change from
request to production. For each step, you capture:

- **Process time** - the time someone is actively working on that step
- **Wait time** - the time the work sits idle between steps (in a queue, awaiting approval, blocked on an environment)
- **Percent Complete and Accurate (%C/A)** - the percentage of work arriving at this step that is usable without rework

The ratio of process time to total time (process time + wait time) is your **flow efficiency**.
Most teams are shocked to discover that their flow efficiency is below 15%, meaning that for
every hour of actual work, there are nearly six hours of waiting.

## Prerequisites

Before running a value stream mapping session, make sure you have:

- **An established, repeatable process.** You are mapping what actually happens, not what should
  happen. If every change follows a different path, start by agreeing on the current "most common"
  path.
- **All stakeholders in the room.** You need representatives from every group involved in delivery:
  developers, testers, operations, security, product, change management. Each person knows the
  wait times and rework loops in their part of the stream that others cannot see.
- **A shared understanding of wait time vs. process time.** Wait time is when work sits idle. Process
  time is when someone is actively working. A code review that takes "two days" but involves 30
  minutes of actual review has 30 minutes of process time and roughly 15.5 hours of wait time.

## Choose Your Mapping Approach

Value stream maps can be built from two directions. Most organizations benefit from starting
bottom-up and then combining into a top-down view, but the right choice depends on where your
delivery pain is concentrated.

### Bottom-Up: Map at the Team Level First

Each delivery team maps its own process independently - from the moment a developer is ready to
push a change to the moment that change is running in production. This is the approach described
in Document Your Current Process, elevated to a
formal value stream map with measured process times, wait times, and %C/A.

**When to use bottom-up:**

- You have multiple teams that each own their own deployment process (or think they do).
- Teams have different pain points and different levels of CD maturity.
- You want each team to own its improvement work rather than waiting for an organizational
  initiative.

**How it works:**

1. Each team maps its own value stream using the session format described below.
2. Teams identify and fix their own constraints. Many constraints are local - flaky tests,
   manual deployment steps, slow code review - and do not require cross-team coordination.
3. After teams have mapped and improved their own streams, combine the maps to reveal
   cross-team dependencies. Lay the team-level maps side by side and draw the connections:
   shared environments, shared libraries, shared approval processes, upstream/downstream
   dependencies.

The combined view often reveals constraints that no single team can see: a shared staging
environment that serializes deployments across five teams, a security review team that is
the bottleneck for every release, or a shared library with a release cycle that blocks
downstream teams for weeks.

**Advantages:** Fast to start, builds team ownership, surfaces team-specific friction that
a high-level map would miss. Teams see results quickly, which builds momentum for the
harder cross-team work.

### Top-Down: Map Across Dependent Teams

Start with the full flow from a customer request (or business initiative) entering the system
to the delivered outcome in production, mapping across every team the work touches. This
produces a single map that shows the end-to-end flow including all inter-team handoffs,
shared queues, and organizational boundaries.

**When to use top-down:**

- Delivery pain is concentrated at the boundaries between teams, not within them.
- A single change routinely touches multiple teams (front-end, back-end, platform,
  data, etc.) and the coordination overhead dominates cycle time.
- Leadership needs a full picture of organizational delivery performance to prioritize
  investment.

**How it works:**

1. Identify a representative value stream - a type of work that flows through the teams
   you want to map. For example: "a customer-facing feature that requires API changes,
   a front-end update, and a database migration."
2. Get representatives from every team in the room. Each person maps their team's portion
   of the flow, including the handoff to the next team.
3. Connect the segments. The gaps between teams - where work queues, waits for
   prioritization, or gets lost in a ticket system - are usually the largest sources of
   delay.

**Advantages:** Reveals organizational constraints that team-level maps cannot see.
Shows the true end-to-end lead time including inter-team wait times. Essential for
changes that require coordinated delivery across multiple teams.

### Combining Both Approaches

The most effective strategy for large organizations:

1. **Start bottom-up.** Have each team document its current process
   and then run its own value stream mapping session. Fix team-level quick wins immediately.
2. **Combine into a top-down view.** Once team-level maps exist, connect them to see the
   full organizational flow. The team-level detail makes the top-down map more accurate
   because each segment was mapped by the people who actually do the work.
3. **Fix constraints at the right level.** Team-level constraints (flaky tests, manual
   deploys) are fixed by the team. Cross-team constraints (shared environments, approval
   bottlenecks, dependency coordination) are fixed at the organizational level.

This layered approach prevents two common failure modes: mapping at too high a level (which
misses team-specific friction) and mapping only at the team level (which misses the
organizational constraints that dominate end-to-end lead time).

## How to Run the Session

### Step 1: Start From Delivery, Work Backward

Begin at the right side of your map - the moment a change reaches production. Then work backward
through every step until you reach the point where a request enters the system. This prevents teams
from getting bogged down in the early stages and never reaching the deployment process, which is
often where the largest delays hide.

Typical steps you will uncover include:

- Request intake and prioritization
- Story refinement and estimation
- Development (coding)
- Code review
- Build and unit tests
- Integration testing
- Manual QA / regression testing
- Security review
- Staging deployment
- User acceptance testing (UAT)
- Change advisory board (CAB) approval
- Production deployment
- Production verification

### Step 2: Capture Process Time and Wait Time for Each Step

For each step on the map, record the process time and the wait time. Use averages if exact numbers
are not available, but prefer real data from your issue tracker, CI system, or deployment logs
when you can get it.

Pay close attention to these migration-critical delays:

- **Handoffs that block flow** - Every time work passes from one team or role to another (dev to QA,
  QA to ops, ops to security), there is a queue. Count the handoffs. Each one is a candidate for
  elimination or automation.
- **Manual gates** - CAB approvals, manual regression testing, sign-off meetings. These often add
  days of wait time for minutes of actual value.
- **Environment provisioning delays** - If developers wait hours or days for a test environment,
  that is a constraint you will need to address in Phase 2.
- **Rework loops** - Any step where work frequently bounces back to a previous step. Track the
  percentage of times this happens. These loops are destroying your cycle time.

### Step 3: Calculate %C/A at Each Step

Percent Complete and Accurate measures the quality of the handoff. Ask each person: "What
percentage of the work you receive from the previous step is usable without needing clarification,
correction, or rework?"

A low %C/A at a step means the upstream step is producing defective output. This is critical
information for your migration plan because it tells you where quality needs to be built in
rather than inspected after the fact.

### Step 4: Identify Constraints (Kaizen Bursts)

Mark the steps with the largest wait times and the lowest %C/A with a "kaizen burst" - a starburst
symbol indicating an improvement opportunity. These are your constraints. They will become the
focus of your migration roadmap.

Common constraints teams discover during their first value stream map:

| Constraint | Typical Impact | Migration Phase to Address |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Long-lived feature branches | Days of integration delay, merge conflicts | Phase 1 (Trunk-Based Development) |
| Manual regression testing | Days to weeks of wait time | Phase 1 (Testing Fundamentals) |
| Environment provisioning | Hours to days of wait time | Phase 2 (Production-Like Environments) |
| CAB / change approval boards | Days of wait time per deployment | Phase 2 (Pipeline Architecture) |
| Manual deployment process | Hours of process time, high error rate | Phase 2 (Single Path to Production) |
| Large batch releases | Weeks of accumulation, high failure rate | Phase 3 (Small Batches) |

## Reading the Results

Once your map is complete, calculate these summary numbers:

- **Total lead time** = sum of all process times + all wait times
- **Total process time** = sum of just the process times
- **Flow efficiency** = total process time / total lead time * 100
- **Number of handoffs** = count of transitions between different teams or roles
- **Rework percentage** = percentage of changes that loop back to a previous step

These numbers become part of your baseline metrics and feed directly into
your work to identify constraints.

## What Good Looks Like

You are not aiming for a perfect value stream map. You are aiming for a shared, honest picture of
reality that the whole team agrees on. The map should be:

- **Visible** - posted on a wall or in a shared digital tool where the team sees it daily
- **Honest** - reflecting what actually happens, including the workarounds and shortcuts
- **Actionable** - with constraints clearly marked so the team knows where to focus

You will revisit and update this map as you progress through each migration phase. It is a living
document, not a one-time exercise.

## Next Step

With your value stream map in hand, proceed to Baseline Metrics to
quantify your current delivery performance.
