## What you are seeing

A developer picks up a work item on Monday. By Wednesday, they are still working on it. By
Friday, it is "almost done." The following Monday, they are fixing edge cases. The item finally
moves to review mid-week as a 300-line pull request that the reviewer does not have time to look
at carefully.

Cycle time is measured in weeks, not days. The team commits to work at the start of the sprint
and scrambles at the end. Estimates are off by a factor of two because large items hide unknowns
that only surface mid-implementation.

## Common causes

### Horizontal Slicing

When work is split by technical layer rather than by user-visible behavior, each item spans an
entire layer and takes days to complete. "Build the database schema," "build the API," "build the
UI" are each multi-day items. Nothing is deployable until all layers are done. Vertical slicing
(cutting thin slices through all layers to deliver complete functionality) produces items that
can be finished in one to two days.

### Monolithic Work Items

When the team takes requirements as they arrive without breaking them into smaller pieces, work
items are as large as the feature they describe. A ticket titled "Add user profile page" hides
a login form, avatar upload, email verification, notification preferences, and password reset.
Without a decomposition practice during refinement, items arrive at planning already too large
to flow.

### Long-Lived Feature Branches

When developers work on branches for days or weeks, the branch and the work item are the same
size: large. The branching model reinforces large items because there is no integration pressure
to finish quickly. Trunk-based development creates natural pressure to keep items small enough to
integrate daily.

### Push-Based Work Assignment

When work is assigned to individuals, swarming is not possible. If the assigned developer hits a
blocker - a dependency, an unclear requirement, a missing skill - they work around it alone rather
than asking for help. Asking for help means pulling a teammate away from their own assigned work,
so developers hesitate. Items sit idle while the assigned person waits or context-switches rather
than the team collectively resolving the blocker.

## How to narrow it down

1. **Are work items split by technical layer?** If the board shows items like "backend for
   feature X" and "frontend for feature X," the decomposition is horizontal. Start with
   Horizontal Slicing.
2. **Do items arrive at planning without being broken down?** If items go from "product owner
   describes a feature" to "developer starts coding" without a decomposition step, start with
   Monolithic Work Items.
3. **Do developers work on branches for more than a day?** If yes, the branching model allows
   and encourages large items. Start with
   Long-Lived Feature Branches.
4. **Do blocked items sit idle rather than getting picked up by another team member?** If work
   stalls because it "belongs to" the assigned person and nobody else touches it, the assignment
   model is preventing swarming. Start with
   Push-Based Work Assignment.
