## What you are seeing

A developer opens an AI chat window to implement a function. They spend ten minutes writing a
[prompt](../../../reference/glossary/#prompt) that describes the requirements, the constraints, the existing patterns in the codebase,
and the edge cases. The AI generates code. The developer reads through it line by line because
they have no [acceptance criteria](../../../reference/glossary/#acceptance-criteria) to verify against. They spot that it uses a different pattern
than the rest of the codebase and misses a constraint they mentioned. They refine the prompt.
The AI produces a second version. It is better but still wrong in a subtle way. The developer
fixes it by hand. Total time: forty minutes. Writing it themselves would have taken fifteen.

This is not a one-time learning curve. It happens repeatedly, on different tasks, across the
team. Developers report that AI tools help with boilerplate and unfamiliar syntax but actively
slow them down on tasks that require domain knowledge, codebase-specific patterns, or
non-obvious constraints. The promise of "10x productivity" collides with the reality that
without clear acceptance criteria, reviewing AI output means auditing the implementation
detail by detail - which is often harder than writing the code from scratch.

## Common causes

### Skipping Specification and Prompting Directly

The most common cause of AI slowdown is jumping straight to code generation without
defining what the change should do. Instead of writing an intent description, [BDD](../../../reference/glossary/#bdd-behavior-driven-development) scenarios,
and acceptance criteria first, the developer writes a long prompt that mixes requirements,
constraints, and implementation hints into a single message. The AI guesses at the scope.
The developer reviews line by line because they have no checklist of expected behaviors. The
prompt-review-fix cycle repeats until the output is close enough.

The specification workflow from the
Agent Delivery Contract exists to
prevent this. When the developer defines the intent (what the change should accomplish), the
BDD scenarios (observable behaviors), and the acceptance criteria (how to verify correctness)
before generating code, the AI has a constrained target and the developer has a checklist.
If the specification for a single change takes more than fifteen minutes, the change is too
large - split it.

[Agents](../../../reference/glossary/#agent-ai) can help with specification itself. The
agent-assisted specification
workflow uses agents to find gaps in your intent, draft BDD scenarios, and surface edge cases -
all before any code is generated. This front-loads the work where it is cheapest: in
conversation, not in implementation review.

### Missing Working Agreements on AI Usage

When the team has no shared understanding of which tasks benefit from AI and which do not,
developers default to using AI on everything. Some tasks - writing a parser for a well-defined
format, generating test fixtures, scaffolding boilerplate - are good AI targets. Other tasks -
implementing complex business rules, debugging production issues, refactoring code with
implicit constraints - are poor AI targets because the context transfer cost exceeds the
implementation cost.

Without a shared agreement, each developer discovers this boundary independently through wasted
time.

### Knowledge Silos

When domain knowledge is concentrated in a few people, the acceptance criteria for domain-heavy
work exist only in those people's heads. They can implement the feature faster than they can
articulate the criteria for an AI prompt. For developers who do not have the domain knowledge,
using AI is equally slow because they lack the criteria to validate the output against. Both
situations produce slowdowns for different reasons - and both trace back to domain knowledge
that has not been made explicit.

## How to narrow it down

1. **Are developers jumping straight to code generation without defining intent, scenarios, and
   acceptance criteria first?** If the prompting-reviewing-fixing cycle consistently takes
   longer than direct implementation, the problem is usually skipped specification, not the AI
   tool. Start with
   Agent-Assisted Specification
   to define what the change should do before generating code.
2. **Does the team have a shared understanding of which tasks are good AI targets?** If
   individual developers are discovering this through trial and error, the team needs [working
   agreements](../../../reference/glossary/#working-agreement). Start with the
   AI Adoption Roadmap to identify
   appropriate use cases.
3. **Are the slowest AI interactions on tasks that require deep domain knowledge?** If AI
   struggles most where implicit business rules govern the implementation, the problem is
   not the AI tool but the knowledge distribution. Start with
   Knowledge Silos.
