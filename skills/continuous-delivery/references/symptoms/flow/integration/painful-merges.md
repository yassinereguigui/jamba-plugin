## What you are seeing

A developer has been working on a feature branch for two weeks. They open a pull request and
discover dozens of conflicts across multiple files. Other developers have changed the same areas
of the codebase. Resolving the conflicts takes a full day. Some conflicts are straightforward
(two people edited adjacent lines), but others are semantic (two people changed the same
function's behavior in different ways). The developer must understand both changes to merge
correctly.

After resolving conflicts, the tests fail. The merged code compiles but does not work because the
two changes are logically incompatible. The developer spends another half-day debugging the
interaction. By the time the branch is merged, the developer has spent more time integrating than
they spent building the feature.

The team knows merging is painful, so they delay it. The delay makes the next merge worse because
more code has diverged. The cycle repeats until someone declares a "merge day" and the team spends
an entire day resolving accumulated drift.

## Common causes

### Long-Lived Feature Branches

When branches live for weeks or months, they accumulate divergence from the main line. The longer
the branch lives, the more changes happen on main that the branch does not include. At merge time,
all of that divergence must be reconciled at once. A branch that is one day old has almost no
conflicts. A branch that is two weeks old may have dozens.

### Integration Deferred

When the team does not practice continuous integration (integrating to main at least daily), each
developer's work diverges independently. The build may be green on each branch but broken when
branches combine. CI means integrating continuously, not running a build server. Without frequent
integration, merge pain is inevitable.

### Monolithic Work Items

When work items are too large to complete in a day or two, developers must stay on a branch for
the duration. A story that takes a week forces a week-long branch. Breaking work into smaller
increments that can be integrated daily eliminates the divergence window that causes painful
merges.

## How to narrow it down

1. **How long do branches typically live before merging?** If branches live longer than two days,
   the branch lifetime is the primary driver of merge pain. Start with
   Long-Lived Feature Branches.
2. **Does the team integrate to main at least once per day?** If developers work in isolation for
   days before integrating, they are not practicing continuous integration regardless of whether a
   CI server exists. Start with
   Integration Deferred.
3. **How large are the typical work items?** If stories take a week or more, the work
   decomposition forces long branches. Start with
   Monolithic Work Items.
