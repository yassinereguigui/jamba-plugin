## What you are seeing

A developer opens a pull request and waits. Hours pass. A day passes. They ping someone in chat.
Eventually, comments arrive, but the author has moved on to something else and has to reload
context to respond. Another round of comments. Another wait. The PR finally merges two or three
days after it was opened.

The team has five or more open PRs at any time. Some are days old. Developers start new work
while they wait, which creates more PRs, which creates more review load, which slows reviews
further.

## Common causes

### Long-Lived Feature Branches

When developers work on branches for days, the resulting PRs are large. Large PRs take longer to
review because reviewers need more time to understand the scope of the change. A 300-line PR is
daunting. A 50-line PR takes 10 minutes. The branch length drives the PR size, which drives the
review delay.

### Knowledge Silos

When only specific individuals can review certain areas of the codebase, those individuals become
bottlenecks. Their review queue grows while other team members who could review are not
considered qualified. The constraint is not review capacity in general but review capacity for
specific code areas concentrated in too few people.

### Push-Based Work Assignment

When work is assigned to individuals, reviewing someone else's code feels like a distraction
from "my work." Every developer has their own assigned stories to protect. Helping a teammate
finish their work by reviewing their PR competes with the developer's own assignments. The
incentive structure deprioritizes collaboration.

## How to narrow it down

1. **Are PRs larger than 200 lines on average?** If yes, the reviews are slow because the
   changes are too large to review quickly. Start with
   Long-Lived Feature Branches
   and the work decomposition that feeds them.
2. **Are reviews waiting on specific individuals?** If most PRs are assigned to or waiting on
   one or two people, the team has a knowledge bottleneck. Start with
   Knowledge Silos.
3. **Do developers treat review as lower priority than their own coding work?** If yes, the
   team's norms do not treat review as a first-class activity. Start with
   Push-Based Work Assignment and
   establish a team working agreement that reviews happen before starting new work.
