## What you are seeing

The team renames a field in an API response and a half-dozen consuming services start failing within minutes of deployment. Some consumers had documentation saying the API might change. Most assumed stability because the API had not changed in two years. The team spends the afternoon rolling back, notifying downstream owners, and coordinating a migration plan that will take weeks.

The harder problem is that the team does not know who depends on their API. Internal consumers are spread across teams and may not have registered their dependency anywhere. External consumers may have been added by third-party integrators years ago. Changing the API requires identifying every consumer and coordinating their migration - a process so expensive that the team simply stops evolving the API. It calcifies around its original design.

This leads to two failure modes: teams break APIs and cause incidents because they underestimate consumer impact, or teams freeze APIs and accumulate technical debt because the coordination cost of changing anything is too high.

## Common causes

### Distributed monolith

When services that are nominally independent must be coordinated in practice, API changes require simultaneous updates across multiple services. The consuming service cannot be deployed until the providing service is deployed, which requires coordinating deployment timing, which turns an API change into a coordinated release event.

Services that are truly independent can manage API compatibility through versioning or parallel versions: the old endpoint stays available while consumers migrate to the new one at their own pace. Consumers stop breaking on deployment day because they were never forced to migrate simultaneously - they adopt the new interface on their own schedule.

### Tightly coupled monolith

Tightly coupled services share data structures and schemas in ways that make changing any shared interface expensive. A change to a shared type propagates through the codebase to every caller. There is no stable interface boundary; internal implementation details leak through the API surface.

Services with well-defined interface contracts - stable public APIs backed by flexible internal implementations - can evolve their internals without breaking consumers. The contract is the stable surface; everything behind it can change.

### Knowledge silos

When knowledge of who consumes which API lives in one person's head or in nobody's head, the team cannot assess the impact of a change. The inventory of consumers is a prerequisite for safe API evolution. Without it, every API change is a known unknown: the team cannot know what they are breaking until it is broken.

Maintaining a service catalog, using contract testing, or even an informal registry of consumer relationships gives the team the ability to evaluate change impact before deploying. The half-dozen services that used to fail within minutes of a deployment now have owners who were notified and prepared in advance - because the team finally knew they existed.

## How to narrow it down

1. **Does the team know every consumer of their APIs?** If consumer inventory is incomplete or unknown, any API change carries unknown risk. Start with Knowledge silos.
2. **Must consuming services be deployed at the same time as the providing service?** If coordinated deployment is required, the services are not truly independent. Start with Distributed monolith.
3. **Do internal implementation changes frequently affect the public API surface?** If internal refactoring breaks consumers, the interface boundary is not stable. Start with Tightly coupled monolith.
