## What you are seeing

The build runs in dev, produces an artifact, and tests run against it. Then the artifact is discarded and a new build runs for the staging branch. The staging artifact is tested, then discarded. A third build runs from the production branch. This is the artifact that gets deployed. The team has no way to verify that the artifact deployed to production is equivalent to the one that was tested in staging.

The problem is subtle until it causes an incident. A build that includes a library version cached in the dev builder but not in the staging builder. A build that captures a slightly different git state because a commit was made between the staging and production builds. An environment variable baked into the build artifact that differs between environments. These differences are usually invisible - until they cause a failure in production that cannot be reproduced anywhere else.

The team treats this as normal because "it has always worked this way." The process was designed when builds were simple and deterministic. As dependencies, build tooling, and environment configurations have grown more complex, the assumption of build equivalence has become increasingly unreliable.

## Common causes

### Snowflake environments

When build environments differ between stages - different OS versions, cached dependency states, or tool versions - the same source code produces different artifacts in different environments. The "staging artifact" and the "production artifact" are built from nominally the same source but in environments with different characteristics.

Standardized build environments defined as code produce the same artifact from the same source, regardless of where the build runs. When the dev build, the staging build, and the production build all run in the same container with the same pinned dependencies, the team can verify that equivalence rather than assuming it. The production failure that could not be reproduced elsewhere becomes reproducible because the environments are no longer different in invisible ways.

### Missing deployment pipeline

A pipeline that promotes a single artifact through environments eliminates the per-environment rebuild entirely. The artifact is built once, assigned a version identifier, stored in an artifact registry, and deployed to each environment in sequence. The artifact that reaches production is exactly the artifact that was tested.

Without a pipeline with artifact promotion, rebuilding per environment is the natural default. Each environment has its own build process, and the relationship between artifacts built for different environments is assumed rather than guaranteed.

## How to narrow it down

1. **Is a separate build triggered for each environment?** If staging and production builds run independently, the artifacts are not guaranteed to be equivalent. Start with Missing deployment pipeline.
2. **Are the build environments for each stage identical?** If dev, staging, and production builds run on different machines with different configurations, the same source will produce different artifacts. Start with Snowflake environments.
3. **Can the team identify the exact artifact version running in production and trace it back to a specific test run?** If not, there is no artifact provenance and no guarantee of what was tested. Start with Missing deployment pipeline.
