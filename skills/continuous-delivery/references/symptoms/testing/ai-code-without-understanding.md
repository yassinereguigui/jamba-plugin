## What you are seeing

A developer asks an AI assistant to implement a feature. The generated code looks plausible.
The tests pass. The developer commits it. Two weeks later, a security review finds the code
accepts unsanitized input in a path nobody specified as an acceptance criterion. When asked
what the change was supposed to do, the developer says, "It implements the feature." When
asked how they validated it, they say, "The tests passed."

This is not an occasional gap. It is a pattern. Developers use AI to produce code faster, but
they do not define what "correct" means before generating code, verify the output against
specific [acceptance criteria](../../reference/glossary/#acceptance-criteria), or consider how they would detect a failure in production. The
code compiles. The tests pass. Nobody validated it against the actual requirements.

The symptoms compound over time. Defects appear in AI-generated code that the team cannot
diagnose quickly because nobody defined what the code was supposed to do beyond "implement
the feature." Fixes are made by asking the AI to fix its own output without re-examining the
original acceptance criteria. Security vulnerabilities - injection flaws, broken access
controls, exposed credentials - ship because nobody asked "what are the security constraints
for this change?" before or after generation.

## Common causes

### Rubber-Stamping AI-Generated Code

When there is no expectation that developers own what a change does and how they validated it -
regardless of who or what wrote the code - AI output gets the same cursory glance as a trivial
formatting change. The team treats "AI wrote it and the tests pass" as sufficient evidence of
correctness. It is not. Passing tests prove the code satisfies the test cases. They do not
prove the code meets the actual requirements or handles the constraints the team cares about.

### Missing Acceptance Criteria

When the work item lacks concrete [acceptance criteria](../../reference/glossary/#acceptance-criteria) - specific inputs, expected outputs,
security constraints, edge cases - neither the developer nor the AI has a clear target. The AI
generates something that looks right. The developer has no checklist to verify it against. The
review is a subjective "does this seem okay?" rather than an objective "does this satisfy every
stated requirement?"

### Inverted Test Pyramid

When the test suite relies heavily on end-to-end tests and lacks targeted unit and component
tests, AI-generated code can pass the suite without its internal logic being verified. A
comprehensive component test suite would catch the cases where the AI's implementation
diverges from the domain rules. Without it, "tests pass" is a weak signal.

## How to narrow it down

1. **Can developers explain what their recent changes do and how they validated them?** Pick
   three recent AI-assisted commits at random and ask the committing developer: what does this
   change accomplish, what acceptance criteria did you verify, and how would you detect if it
   were wrong? If they cannot answer, the review process is not catching unexamined code.
   Start with
   Rubber-Stamping AI-Generated Code.
2. **Do your work items include specific, testable acceptance criteria before implementation
   starts?** If acceptance criteria are vague or added after the fact, neither the AI nor the
   developer has a clear target. Start with
   Monolithic Work Items.
3. **Does your test suite include component tests that verify business rules with specific
   inputs and outputs?** If the suite is mostly end-to-end or integration tests, AI-generated
   code can satisfy them without being correct at the rule level. Start with
   Inverted Test Pyramid.
