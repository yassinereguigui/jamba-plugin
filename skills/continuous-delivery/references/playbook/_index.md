  Focused, standalone improvement plays teams can run independently or as part of a larger CD migration.

Each play targets a common delivery challenge. You can run any play in isolation or stack several as part of a broader improvement push. Most take one sprint or less to get the first results.

## Baseline Your Delivery Metrics

**What:** Capture two sets of numbers before making any other changes: CI health metrics
(integration frequency, build success rate, time to fix a broken build) and the four
DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, mean time to restore).

**Why:** CI health metrics are leading indicators - they move immediately when team behaviors change
and surface problems while they are still small. DORA metrics are lagging outcomes - they confirm
that improvement is compounding into better delivery performance. You need both.

**How to measure success:** You have numbers for all seven metrics written down and dated. The team
tracks CI health metrics weekly to drive improvement experiments. DORA metrics are reviewed monthly
to confirm progress.

## Run a Story Slicing Workshop

**What:** In one sprint planning session, take every story estimated at more than 2 days and break it into vertical slices that each deliver testable behavior. Do not start any story that fails this check.

**Why:** Large stories are the hidden root cause of delayed integration, painful code reviews, and long lead times. A team that cannot slice stories cannot do CD. This is the foundational skill.

**How to measure success:** Average story cycle time drops below 2 days within two sprints. Work in progress count decreases.

## Stop the Line on a Broken Pipeline

**What:** For one sprint, enforce a team rule: nothing moves forward when the pipeline is red. The whole team stops and fixes it before picking up new work.

**Why:** A pipeline that is sometimes broken is untrustworthy. Teams learn to ignore failures, which means they learn to ignore feedback. A consistently green pipeline is the foundation CD depends on.

**How to measure success:** Pipeline failure time (time the pipeline spends red) drops to near zero. Time-to-fix when failures do occur shortens to under 10 minutes.

## Delete Your Long-Lived Branches

**What:** Identify every branch that has been open for more than 3 days. Merge or delete each one this week. Going forward, set a team rule that no branch lives longer than one day before integrating to trunk.

**Why:** Long-lived branches are integration debt. Every day a branch stays open, merging it back gets more expensive. The pain is not caused by merging - it is caused by waiting to merge.

**How to measure success:** No branches older than 1 day. Merge conflict time drops to near zero. Development cycle time decreases.

## Add a Test Before Fixing the Next Bug

**What:** Before fixing any bug, write a failing automated test that reproduces it first. Then make the test pass. Apply this rule to every bug fixed from this point forward.

**Why:** Bugs without tests get reintroduced. This builds test coverage organically where it matters most - in the failure modes your system has already demonstrated. It requires no upfront investment and delivers immediate value.

**How to measure success:** Defect recurrence rate drops. The team can point to a test for every recent bug fix. Coverage grows on critical paths without a dedicated "write tests" project.

## Remove One Manual Step from Your Pipeline

**What:** Map every step in your deployment process. Pick the one manual step that takes the most time or requires the most coordination. Automate it this sprint.

**Why:** Manual steps create friction, variation, and key-person dependencies. Each one is a deployment delay that compounds over time. Removing one makes the next one easier to see and remove.

**How to measure success:** That deployment step no longer requires a person. Deployment time decreases. The specific bottleneck person is no longer needed for that step.

## Limit Work in Progress

**What:** For one sprint, enforce a rule: each developer works on one story at a time to completion before starting another. No story is in progress unless someone is actively working on it right now.

**Why:** WIP is the primary driver of long lead times. Every item sitting in-progress but not being worked on extends the queue for everything behind it. Reducing WIP is often the fastest path to faster delivery.

**How to measure success:** Lead time for changes decreases within 2-3 sprints. Fewer stories carry over between sprints.

## Switch from Assigning Work to Pulling Work

**What:** Stop pre-assigning stories to individuals at sprint planning. Instead, order the backlog
by priority, leave all items unassigned, and have developers pull the top available item whenever
they need work - swarming to help finish in-progress items before starting anything new.

**Why:** Push-based assignment optimizes for keeping individuals busy, not for finishing work.
It creates knowledge silos, hides bottlenecks, and makes code review feel like a distraction
from "my stories." Pull-based work makes bottlenecks visible, self-balances workloads, and
aligns the whole team around completing the highest-priority item.

**How to measure success:** Pre-assigned stories at sprint start drops to near zero. Work in
progress decreases. Development cycle time shortens within 2-3 sprints as
swarming increases. Knowledge of the codebase broadens across the team over time.

## Write Your Definition of Deployable

**What:** As a team, decide and document exactly what "ready to deploy to production" means. List every criterion. Automate as many as possible as pipeline gates.

**Why:** Without a shared definition, "deployable" means whatever the most risk-averse person in the room decides at the moment. This creates deployment anxiety and inconsistency that blocks CD. A written, automated definition removes the ambiguity.

**How to measure success:** Deployment decisions are consistent across team members. No deployment is blocked by a subjective manual checklist. The criteria are enforced in the pipeline, not in a meeting.
