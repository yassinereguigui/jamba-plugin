## What This Looks Like

The tech lead is in a stakeholder meeting negotiating scope for a feature. Thirty minutes later,
they are reviewing a pull request. An hour after that, they are on a call with a different
stakeholder who has a different priority. The backlog has items from five stakeholders with no
clear ranking. When a developer asks "which of these should I work on first?" the tech lead
guesses based on whoever was loudest most recently.

Common variations:

- **The tech-lead-as-product-owner.** The tech lead writes requirements, prioritizes the backlog,
  manages stakeholders, reviews code, and writes code. They are the bottleneck for every decision.
  The team waits for them constantly.
- **The committee of stakeholders.** Multiple business stakeholders submit requests directly to the
  team. Each considers their request the top priority. The team receives conflicting direction and
  has no authority to say no or negotiate scope.
- **The requirements churn.** Without someone who owns the product direction, requirements change
  frequently. A developer is midway through implementing a feature when the requirements shift
  because a different stakeholder weighed in. Work already done is discarded or reworked.
- **The absent product owner.** The role exists on paper, but the person is shared across multiple
  teams, unavailable for daily questions, or does not understand the product well enough to make
  decisions. The tech lead fills the gap by default.

The telltale sign: the team cannot answer "what is the most important thing to work on next?"
without escalating to a meeting.

## Why This Is a Problem

Product ownership is a full-time responsibility. When it is absorbed into a technical role or
distributed across multiple stakeholders, the team lacks clear direction and the person filling
the gap burns out from an impossible workload.

### It reduces quality

A tech lead splitting time between product decisions and code review does neither well. Code
reviews are rushed because the next stakeholder meeting is in ten minutes. Product decisions are
uninformed because the tech lead has not had time to research the user need. The team builds
features based on incomplete or shifting requirements, and the result is software that does not
quite solve the problem.

A dedicated product owner can invest the time to understand user needs deeply, write clear
acceptance criteria, and be available to answer questions as developers work. The resulting
software is better because the requirements were better.

### It increases rework

When requirements change mid-implementation, work already done is wasted. A developer who spent
three days on a feature that shifts direction has three days of rework. Multiply this across the
team and across sprints, and a significant portion of the team's capacity goes to rebuilding
rather than building.

Clear product ownership reduces churn because one person owns the direction and can protect the
team from scope changes mid-sprint. Changes go into the backlog for the next sprint rather than
disrupting work in progress.

### It makes delivery timelines unpredictable

Without a single prioritized backlog, the team does not know what they are delivering next.
Planning is a negotiation among competing stakeholders rather than a selection from a ranked list.
The team commits to work that gets reshuffled when a louder stakeholder appears. Sprint
commitments are unreliable because the commitment itself changes.

A product owner who maintains a single, ranked backlog gives the team a stable input. The team
can plan, commit, and deliver with confidence because the priorities do not shift beneath them.

### It burns out technical leaders

A tech lead handling product ownership, technical leadership, and individual contribution is
doing three jobs. They work longer hours to keep up. They become the bottleneck for every
decision. They cannot delegate because there is nobody to delegate the product work to. Over
time, they either burn out and leave, or they drop one of the responsibilities silently. Usually
the one that drops is their own coding or the quality of their code reviews.

### Impact on continuous delivery

CD requires a team that knows what to deliver and can deliver it without waiting for decisions.
When product ownership is missing, the team waits for requirements clarification, priority
decisions, and scope negotiations. These waits break the flow that CD depends on. The pipeline
may be technically capable of deploying continuously, but there is nothing ready to deploy
because the team spent the sprint chasing shifting requirements.

## How to Fix It

### Step 1: Make the gap visible

Track how much time the tech lead spends on product decisions versus technical work. Track how
often the team is blocked waiting for requirements clarification or priority decisions. Present
this data to leadership as the cost of not having a dedicated product owner.

### Step 2: Establish a single backlog with a single owner

Until a dedicated product owner is hired or assigned, designate one person as the interim backlog
owner. This person has the authority to rank items and say no to new requests mid-sprint.
Stakeholders submit requests to the backlog, not directly to developers.

### Step 3: Shield the team from requirements churn

Adopt a rule: requirements do not change for items already in the sprint. New information goes
into the backlog for next sprint. If something is truly urgent, it displaces another item of
equal or greater size. The team finishes what they started.

### Step 4: Advocate for a dedicated product owner

Use the data from Step 1 to make the case. Show the cost of the tech lead's split attention in
terms of missed commitments, rework from requirements churn, and delivery delays from decision
bottlenecks. The cost of a dedicated product owner is almost always less than the cost of not
having one.

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "The tech lead knows the product best" | Knowing the product and owning the product are different jobs. The tech lead's product knowledge is valuable input. But making them responsible for stakeholder management, prioritization, and requirements on top of technical leadership guarantees that none of these get adequate attention. |
| "We can't justify a dedicated product owner for this team" | Calculate the cost of the tech lead's time on product work, the rework from requirements churn, and the delays from decision bottlenecks. That cost is being paid already. A dedicated product owner makes it explicit and more effective. |
| "Stakeholders need direct access to developers" | Stakeholders need their problems solved, not direct access. A product owner who understands the business context can translate needs into well-defined work items more effectively than a developer interpreting requests mid-conversation. |

## Measuring Progress

| Metric | What to look for |
|--------|-----------------:|
| Time tech lead spends on product decisions | Should decrease toward zero as a dedicated owner takes over |
| Blocks waiting for requirements or priority decisions | Should decrease as a single backlog owner provides clear direction |
| Mid-sprint requirements changes | Should decrease as the backlog owner shields the team from churn |
| Development cycle time | Should decrease as the team stops waiting for decisions |
