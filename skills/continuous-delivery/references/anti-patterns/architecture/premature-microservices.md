## What This Looks Like

The team split their application into services because "microservices are how you do DevOps." The
boundaries might even be reasonable. Each service owns its domain. Contracts are versioned. The
architecture diagrams look clean. But the team is six developers, the application handles modest
traffic, and nobody has ever needed to scale one component independently of the others.

The team now maintains a dozen repositories, a dozen pipelines, a dozen deployment configurations,
and a service mesh. A feature that touches two domains requires changes in two repositories, two
code reviews, two deployments, and careful contract coordination. A shared library update means
twelve PRs. A security patch means twelve pipeline runs. The team spends more time on service
infrastructure than on features.

Common variations:

- **The cargo cult.** The team adopted microservices because a conference talk, blog post, or
  executive mandate said it was the right architecture. The decision was not based on a specific
  delivery problem. The application had no scaling bottleneck, no team autonomy constraint, and
  no deployment frequency goal that a monolith could not meet.
- **The resume-driven architecture.** The technical lead chose microservices because they wanted
  experience with the pattern. The architecture serves the team's learning goals, not the
  product's delivery needs.
- **The premature split.** A small team split a working monolith into services before the monolith
  caused delivery problems. The team now spends more time managing service infrastructure than
  building features. The monolith was delivering faster.
- **The infrastructure gap.** The team adopted microservices but does not have centralized logging,
  distributed tracing, automated service discovery, or container orchestration. Debugging a
  production issue means SSH-ing into individual servers and correlating timestamps across log
  files manually. The operational maturity does not match the architectural complexity.

The telltale sign: the team spends more time on service infrastructure, cross-service debugging,
and pipeline maintenance than on delivering features, and nobody can name the specific problem
that microservices solved.

## Why This Is a Problem

Microservices solve specific problems at specific scales: enabling independent deployment for
large organizations, allowing components to scale independently under different load profiles, and
letting autonomous teams own their domain end-to-end. When none of these problems exist, every
service boundary is pure overhead.

### It reduces quality

A distributed system introduces failure modes that do not exist in a monolith: network partitions,
partial failures, message ordering issues, and data consistency challenges across service
boundaries. Each requires deliberate engineering to handle correctly. A team that adopted
microservices without distributed-systems experience will get these wrong. Services will fail
silently when a dependency is slow. Data will become inconsistent because transactions do not span
service boundaries. Retry logic will be missing or incorrect.

A well-structured monolith avoids all of these failure modes. Function calls within a process are
reliable, fast, and transactional. The quality bar for a monolith is achievable by any team. The
quality bar for a distributed system requires specific expertise.

### It increases rework

The operational tax of microservices is proportional to the number of services. Updating a shared
library means updating it in every repository. A framework upgrade requires running every pipeline.
A cross-cutting concern (logging format change, authentication update, error handling convention)
means touching every service. In a monolith, these are single changes. In a microservices
architecture, they are multiplied by the service count.

This tax is worth paying when the benefits are real (independent scaling, team autonomy). When the
benefits are theoretical, the tax is pure waste.

### It makes delivery timelines unpredictable

Distributed-system problems are hard to diagnose. A latency spike in one service causes timeouts
in three others. The developer investigating the issue traces the request across services, reads
logs from multiple systems, and eventually finds a connection pool exhausted in a downstream
service. This investigation takes hours. In a monolith, the same issue would have been a stack
trace in a single process.

Feature delivery is also slower. A change that spans two services requires coordinating two PRs,
two reviews, two deployments, and verifying that the contract between them is correct. In a
monolith, the same change is a single PR with a single deployment.

### It creates an operational maturity gap

Microservices require operational capabilities that monoliths do not: centralized logging,
distributed tracing, service mesh or discovery, container orchestration, automated scaling, and
health-check-based routing. Without these, the team cannot observe, debug, or operate their
system reliably.

Teams that adopt microservices before building this operational foundation end up in a worse
position than they were with the monolith. The monolith was at least observable: one application,
one log stream, one deployment. The microservices architecture without operational tooling is a
collection of black boxes.

### Impact on continuous delivery

Microservices are often adopted in the name of CD, but premature adoption makes CD harder. CD
requires fast, reliable pipelines. A team managing twelve service pipelines without automation
or standardization spends its pipeline investment twelve times over. The same team with a
well-structured monolith and one pipeline could be deploying to production multiple times per day.

The path to CD does not require microservices. It requires a well-tested, well-structured codebase
with automated deployment. A modular monolith with clear internal boundaries and a single pipeline
can achieve deployment frequencies that most premature microservices architectures struggle to
match.

## How to Fix It

### Step 1: Assess whether microservices are solving a real problem

Answer these questions honestly:

- Does the team have a scaling bottleneck that requires independent scaling of specific
  components? (Not theoretical future scale. An actual current bottleneck.)
- Are there multiple autonomous teams that need to deploy independently? (Not a single team that
  split into "service teams" to match the architecture.)
- Is the monolith's deployment frequency limited by its size or coupling? (Not by process,
  testing gaps, or organizational constraints that would also limit microservices.)

If the answer to all three is no, the team does not need microservices. A modular monolith will
deliver faster with less operational overhead.

### Step 2: Consolidate services that do not need independence (Weeks 2-6)

Merge services that are always deployed together. If Service A and Service B have never been
deployed independently, they are not independent services. They are modules that should share a
deployment. This is not a failure. It is a course correction based on evidence.

Prioritize merging services owned by the same team. A single team running six services gets the
same team autonomy benefit from one well-structured deployable.

### Step 3: Build operational maturity for what remains (Weeks 4-8)

For services that genuinely benefit from separation, ensure the team has the operational
capabilities to manage them:

- Centralized logging across all services
- Distributed tracing for cross-service requests
- Health checks and automated rollback in every pipeline
- Monitoring and alerting for each service
- A standardized pipeline template that new services adopt by default

Each missing capability is a reason to pause and invest in the platform before adding more
services.

### Step 4: Establish a service extraction checklist (Ongoing)

Before extracting any new service, require answers to:

1. What specific problem does this service solve that a module cannot?
2. Does the team have the operational tooling to observe and debug it?
3. Will this service be deployed independently, or will it always deploy with others?
4. Is there a team that will own it long-term?

If any answer is unsatisfactory, keep it as a module.

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Microservices are the industry standard" | Microservices are a tool for specific problems at specific scales. Netflix and Spotify adopted them because they had thousands of developers and needed team autonomy. A team of ten does not have that problem. |
| "We already invested in the split" | Sunk cost. If the architecture is making delivery slower, continuing to invest in it makes delivery even slower. Merging services back is cheaper than maintaining unnecessary complexity indefinitely. |
| "We need microservices for CD" | CD requires automated testing, a reliable pipeline, and small deployable changes. A modular monolith provides all three. Microservices are one way to achieve independent deployment, but they are not a prerequisite. |
| "But we might need to scale later" | Design for today's constraints, not tomorrow's speculation. If scaling demands emerge, extract the specific component that needs to scale. Premature decomposition solves problems you do not have while creating problems you do. |

## Measuring Progress

| Metric | What to look for |
|--------|-----------------:|
| Services that are always deployed together | Should be merged into a single deployable unit |
| Time spent on service infrastructure versus features | Should shift toward features as services are consolidated |
| Pipeline maintenance overhead | Should decrease as the number of pipelines decreases |
| Lead time | Should decrease as operational overhead shrinks |
| Change fail rate | Should decrease as distributed-system failure modes are eliminated |
