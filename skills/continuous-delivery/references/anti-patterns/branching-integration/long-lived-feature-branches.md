## What This Looks Like

A developer creates a branch to build a feature. The feature is bigger than expected. Days pass,
then weeks. Other developers are doing the same thing on their own branches. Trunk moves forward
while each branch diverges further from it. Nobody integrates until the feature is "done" - and
by then, the branch is hundreds or thousands of lines different from where it started.

When the merge finally happens, it is an event. The developer sets aside half a day - sometimes
more - to resolve conflicts, re-test, and fix the subtle breakages that come from combining weeks
of divergent work. Other developers delay their merges to avoid the chaos. The team's Slack channel
lights up with "don't merge right now, I'm resolving conflicts." Every merge creates a window where
trunk is unstable.

Common variations:

- **The "feature branch" that is really a project.** A branch named `feature/new-checkout` that
  lasts three months. Multiple developers commit to it. It has its own bug fixes and its own
  merge conflicts. It is a parallel fork of the product.
- **The "I'll merge when it's ready" branch.** The developer views the branch as a private workspace.
  Merging to trunk is the last step, not a daily practice. The branch falls further behind each day
  but the developer does not notice until merge day.
- **The per-sprint branch.** Each sprint gets a branch. All sprint work goes there. The branch is
  merged at sprint end and a new one is created. Integration happens every two weeks instead of
  every day.
- **The release isolation branch.** A branch is created weeks before a release to "stabilize" it.
  Bug fixes must be applied to both the release branch and trunk. Developers maintain two streams
  of work simultaneously.
- **The "too risky to merge" branch.** The branch has diverged so far that nobody wants to attempt
  the merge. It sits for weeks while the team debates how to proceed. Sometimes it is abandoned
  entirely and the work is restarted.

The telltale sign: if merging a branch requires scheduling a block of time, notifying the team, or
hoping nothing goes wrong - branches are living too long.

## Why This Is a Problem

Long-lived feature branches appear safe. Each developer works in isolation, free from interference.
But that isolation is precisely the problem. It delays integration, hides conflicts, and creates
compounding risk that makes every aspect of delivery harder.

### It reduces quality

When a branch lives for weeks, code review becomes a formidable task. The reviewer faces hundreds
of changed lines across dozens of files. Meaningful review is nearly impossible at that scale -
studies consistently show that review effectiveness drops sharply after 200-400 lines of change.
Reviewers skim, approve, and hope for the best. Subtle bugs, design problems, and missed edge
cases survive because nobody can hold the full changeset in their head.

The isolation also means developers make decisions in a vacuum. Two developers on separate branches
may solve the same problem differently, introduce duplicate abstractions, or make contradictory
assumptions about shared code. These conflicts are invisible until merge time, when they surface as
bugs rather than design discussions.

With short-lived branches or trunk-based development, changes are small enough for genuine review.
A 50-line change gets careful attention. Design disagreements surface within hours, not weeks. The
team maintains a shared understanding of how the codebase is evolving because they see every change
as it happens.

### It increases rework

Long-lived branches guarantee merge conflicts. Two developers editing the same file on different
branches will not discover the collision until one of them merges. The second developer must then
reconcile their changes against an unfamiliar modification, often without understanding the intent
behind it. This manual reconciliation is rework in its purest form - effort spent making code work
together that would have been unnecessary if the developers had integrated daily.

The rework compounds. A developer who rebases a three-week branch against trunk may introduce
bugs during conflict resolution. Those bugs require debugging. The debugging reveals an assumption
that was valid three weeks ago but is no longer true because trunk has changed. Now the developer
must rethink and partially rewrite their approach. What should have been a day of work becomes a
week.

When developers integrate daily, conflicts are small - typically a few lines. They are resolved in
minutes with full context because both changes are fresh. The cost of integration stays constant
rather than growing exponentially with branch age.

### It makes delivery timelines unpredictable

A two-day feature on a long-lived branch takes two days to build and an unknown number of days
to merge. The merge might take an hour. It might take two days. It might surface a design conflict
that requires reworking the feature. Nobody knows until they try. This makes it impossible to
predict when work will actually be done.

The queuing effect makes it worse. When several branches need to merge, they form a queue. The
first merge changes trunk, which means the second branch needs to rebase against the new trunk
before merging. If the second merge is large, it changes trunk again, and the third branch must
rebase. Each merge invalidates the work done to prepare the next one. Teams that "schedule" their
merges are admitting that integration is so costly it needs coordination.

Project managers learn they cannot trust estimates. "The feature is code-complete" does not mean
it is done - it means the merge has not started yet. Stakeholders lose confidence in the team's
ability to deliver on time because "done" and "deployed" are separated by an unpredictable gap.

With continuous integration, there is no merge queue. Each developer integrates small changes
throughout the day. The time from "code-complete" to "integrated and tested" is minutes, not days.
Delivery dates become predictable because the integration cost is near zero.

### It hides risk until the worst possible moment

Long-lived branches create an illusion of progress. The team has five features "in development,"
each on its own branch. The features appear to be independent and on track. But the risk is
hidden: none of these features have been proven to work together. The branches may contain
conflicting changes, incompatible assumptions, or integration bugs that only surface when combined.

All of that hidden risk materializes at merge time - the moment closest to the planned release
date, when the team has the least time to deal with it. A merge conflict discovered three weeks
before release is an inconvenience. A merge conflict discovered the day before release is a crisis.
Long-lived branches systematically push risk discovery to the latest possible point.

Continuous integration surfaces risk immediately. If two changes conflict, the team discovers it
within hours, while both changes are small and the authors still have full context. Risk is
distributed evenly across the development cycle instead of concentrated at the end.

### Impact on continuous delivery

Continuous delivery requires that trunk is always in a deployable state and that any commit can be
released at any time. Long-lived feature branches make both impossible. Trunk cannot be deployable
if large, poorly validated merges land periodically and destabilize it. You cannot release any commit
if the latest commit is a 2,000-line merge that has not been fully tested.

Long-lived branches also prevent continuous integration - the practice of integrating every
developer's work into trunk at least once per day. Without continuous integration, there is no
continuous delivery. The pipeline cannot provide fast feedback on changes that exist only on
private branches. The team cannot practice deploying small changes because there are no small
changes - only large merges separated by days or weeks of silence.

Every other CD practice - automated testing, pipeline automation, small batches, fast feedback -
is undermined when the branching model prevents frequent integration.

## How to Fix It

### Step 1: Measure your current branch lifetimes

Before changing anything, understand the baseline. For every open branch:

1. Record when it was created and when (or if) it was last merged.
2. Calculate the age in days.
3. Note the number of changed files and lines.

Most teams are shocked by their own numbers. A branch they think of as "a few days old" is often
two or three weeks old. Making the data visible creates urgency.

Set a target: no branch older than one day. This will feel aggressive. That is the point.

### Step 2: Set a branch lifetime limit and make it visible

Agree as a team on a maximum branch lifetime. Start with two days if one day feels too aggressive.
The important thing is to pick a number and enforce it.

Make the limit visible:

- Add a dashboard or report that shows branch age for every open branch.
- Flag any branch that exceeds the limit in the daily standup.
- If your CI tool supports it, add a check that warns when a branch exceeds 24 hours.

The limit creates a forcing function. Developers must either integrate quickly or break their work
into smaller pieces. Both outcomes are desirable.

### Step 3: Break large features into small, integrable changes (Weeks 2-3)

The most common objection is "my feature is too big to merge in a day." This is true when the
feature is designed as a monolithic unit. The fix is decomposition:

- **Branch by abstraction.** Introduce a new code path alongside the old one. Merge the new code
  path in small increments. Switch over when ready.
- **Feature flags.** Hide incomplete work behind a toggle so it can be merged to trunk without
  being visible to users.
- **Keystone interface pattern.** Build all the back-end work first, merge it incrementally, and
  add the UI entry point last. The feature is invisible until the keystone is placed.
- **Vertical slices.** Deliver the feature as a series of thin, user-visible increments instead of
  building all layers at once.

Each technique lets developers merge daily without exposing incomplete functionality. The feature
grows incrementally on trunk rather than in isolation on a branch.

### Step 4: Adopt short-lived branches with daily integration (Weeks 3-4)

Change the team's workflow:

1. Create a branch from trunk.
2. Make a small, focused change.
3. Get a quick review (the change is small, so review takes minutes).
4. Merge to trunk. Delete the branch.
5. Repeat.

Each branch lives for hours, not days. If a branch cannot be merged by end of day, it is too
large. The developer should either merge what they have (using one of the decomposition techniques
above) or discard the branch and start smaller tomorrow.

Pair this with the team's code review practice. Small changes enable fast reviews, and fast reviews
enable short-lived branches. The two practices reinforce each other.

### Step 5: Address the objections (Weeks 3-4)

| Objection                                                      | Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "My feature takes three weeks - I can't merge in a day"        | The feature takes three weeks. The branch does not have to. Use branch by abstraction, feature flags, or vertical slicing to merge daily while the feature grows incrementally on trunk.                                                              |
| "Merging incomplete code to trunk is dangerous"                | Incomplete code behind a feature flag or without a UI entry point is not dangerous - it is invisible. The danger is a three-week branch that lands as a single untested merge.                                                                        |
| "I need my branch to keep my work separate from other changes" | That separation is the problem. You want to discover conflicts early, when they are small and cheap to fix. A branch that hides conflicts for three weeks is not protecting you - it is accumulating risk.                                            |
| "We tried short-lived branches and it was chaos"               | Short-lived branches require supporting practices: feature flags, good decomposition, fast CI, and a culture of small changes. Without those supports, it will feel chaotic. The fix is to build the supports, not to retreat to long-lived branches. |
| "Code review takes too long for daily merges"                  | Small changes take minutes to review, not hours. If reviews are slow, that is a review process problem, not a branching problem. See PRs Waiting for Review.                                                |

### Step 6: Continuously tighten the limit

Once the team is comfortable with two-day branches, reduce the limit to one day. Then push toward
integrating multiple times per day. Each reduction surfaces new problems - features that are hard
to decompose, tests that are slow, reviews that are bottlenecked - and each problem is worth
solving because it blocks the flow of work.

The goal is continuous integration: every developer integrates to trunk at least once per day.
At that point, "branches" are just short-lived workspaces that exist for hours, and merging is
a non-event.

## Measuring Progress

| Metric | What to look for |
|--------|-----------------|
| Average branch lifetime | Should decrease to under one day |
| Maximum branch lifetime | No branch should exceed two days |
| Integration frequency | Should increase toward at least daily per developer |
| Merge conflict frequency | Should decrease as branches get shorter |
| Merge duration | Should decrease from hours to minutes |
| Development cycle time | Should decrease as integration overhead drops |
| Lines changed per merge | Should decrease as changes get smaller |

## Team Discussion

Use these questions in a retrospective to explore how this anti-pattern affects your team:

- What is the average age of open branches in our repository right now?
- When was our last painful merge? What made it painful - time, conflicts, or broken tests?
- If every branch had to merge within two days, what would we need to change about how we slice work?
