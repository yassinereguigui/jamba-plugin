## What This Looks Like

The team has branches named `release/2.1`, `release/2.2`, and `release/2.3`, each representing a
version in active use. When a developer fixes a bug on trunk, the fix needs to go into all three
release branches because customers are running all three versions. The developer fixes the bug once,
then applies the same fix three times via cherry-pick, one branch at a time. Each cherry-pick
requires a separate review, a separate CI run, and a separate deployment.

If the bug fix applies cleanly, the process takes an afternoon. If any of the release branches
has diverged enough that the cherry-pick conflicts, the developer must manually resolve the
conflict in a version of the code they are not familiar with. When the conflict is non-trivial,
the fix on the older branch may need to be reimplemented from scratch because the surrounding
code is different enough that the original approach does not apply.

Common variations:

- **The customer-pinned version.** A major enterprise customer is on version 2.1 and cannot
  upgrade due to internal approval processes. Every security fix must be backported to 2.1 until
  the customer eventually migrates - which takes years. One customer extends your maintenance
  obligations indefinitely.
- **The parallel feature tracks.** Separate release branches carry different feature sets for
  different customer segments. A fix to a shared component must go into every feature track.
  The team has effectively built multiple products that share a codebase but diverge continuously.
- **The release-then-hotfix cycle.** A release branch is created for stabilization, bugs are
  found during stabilization, fixes are applied to the release branch, those fixes are then
  backported to trunk. Then the next release branch is created, and the cycle repeats.
- **The version cemetery.** Branches for old versions are never officially retired. The team
  has vague commitments to "support" old versions. Backporting requests arrive sporadically.
  Developers fix bugs in version branches they have never worked in, without understanding the
  full context of why the code looked the way it did.

The telltale sign: when a developer fixes a bug, the first question is "which branches does
this need to go into?" - and the answer is usually more than one.

## Why This Is a Problem

Release branches with backporting look like a reasonable support strategy. Customers want
stability in the version they have deployed. But the branch strategy trades customer stability
for developer instability: the team can never move cleanly forward because they are always
partially living in the past.

### It reduces quality

A fix that works on trunk introduces a new bug on the release branch because the surrounding code is different enough that the original approach no longer applies. That regression appears in a version the team tests less rigorously, and is reported by a customer weeks later. Backporting a fix to a different codebase version is not the same as applying the fix in context.
The release branch may have a different version of the code surrounding the bug. The fix that
correctly handles the problem on trunk may be incorrect, incomplete, or inapplicable on the
release branch. The developer doing the backport must evaluate the fix in a context they did not
write and may not fully understand.

This creates a category of bugs unique to backporting: fixes that work on trunk but introduce
new problems on the release branch. By the time a customer reports the regression,
the developer who did the backport has moved on and may not even remember the original fix.

When a team runs a single releasable trunk, every fix is applied once, in context, by the developer
who understands the change. The quality of the fix is limited only by that developer's understanding

- not by the combinatorial complexity of applying it across multiple code states.

### It increases rework

The rework in a backporting workflow is structural. Every fix done once on trunk becomes multiple
units of work: one cherry-pick per maintained release branch, each with its own review and CI run.
Three branches means three times the work. Five branches means five times the work. The rework
is not optional - it is built into the process.

Conflict resolution compounds the rework. A backport that conflicts requires the developer to
understand the conflict, decide how to resolve it, and verify the resolution is correct. Each of
these steps can be as expensive as the original fix. A one-hour bug fix can become three hours
of backporting work, much of it spent reworking the fix in unfamiliar code.

Backport tracking is also rework. Someone must maintain the record of which fixes have been
applied to which branches. When the record is incomplete - which it always is - bugs that were
fixed on trunk reappear in release branches, requiring diagnosis to confirm they were fixed and
investigation to understand why the fix did not propagate.

### It makes delivery timelines unpredictable

When a critical security vulnerability is disclosed, the team must patch all supported release
branches simultaneously. The time required is a multiple of the number of branches times the
complexity of each backport. That time cannot be estimated in advance because conflicts are
unpredictable. A patch that takes two hours to develop can take two days to backport if release
branches have diverged significantly.

For planned features and improvements, the release branch strategy introduces a ceiling on
development velocity. The team can only move as fast as they can service all their active
branches. As branches accumulate, the overhead per feature grows until the team is spending more
time backporting than developing. At that point, the team is maintaining the past rather than
building the future.

Planning also becomes unreliable because backport work is interrupt-driven. A customer escalation
against an old version stops forward work. The interrupt is not predictable in advance, so sprint
commitments cannot account for it.

### It creates maintenance debt that compounds over time

New developers join and find release branches full of code that looks nothing like trunk, written by people who have left, with no tests and no documentation. That is not a warning sign of future problems - it is the current state of teams with five active release branches. Each additional release branch increases the maintenance surface. Two branches is twice the
maintenance of one. Five branches is five times the maintenance. As branches age, the code on them
diverges further from trunk, making future backports increasingly difficult. The team can never
retire a branch safely because they do not know who is using it or what they would break.

Over time, the team accumulates branches they cannot merge back to trunk - the divergence is too
large - and cannot delete without risking customer impact. The branches become frozen artifacts
that must be preserved indefinitely.

### Impact on continuous delivery

CD requires a single path to production through trunk. Release branches with backporting create
multiple parallel paths, each with its own test results, its own deployments, and its own risks.
The pipeline cannot provide a single authoritative signal about system health because there are
multiple systems, each evolving independently.

The backporting overhead also limits how fast the team can respond to production issues. When a
bug is found in production, the fix must pass through multiple branch-specific pipelines before
all affected versions are patched. In CD, a fix from commit to production can take minutes. In a
multi-branch environment, the same fix might not reach all affected versions for days, because
each branch has its own queue of testing and deployment.

## How to Fix It

Eliminating release branches requires changing how versioning and customer support commitments
are handled. The technical changes are straightforward. The harder changes are organizational:
how the team handles customer upgrade requests, how compatibility is maintained, and how support
commitments are scoped.

### Step 1: Inventory all active release branches and their consumers

Before retiring any branch, understand who depends on it.

1. List every active release branch and when it was created.
2. For each branch, identify what customers or systems are running that version.
3. Identify the date of the last backport to each branch.
4. Assess how far each branch has diverged from trunk.

This inventory usually reveals that some branches have no known active consumers and can be
retired immediately. Others have consumers who could upgrade but have not been prompted to.
Only a small number typically have consumers with genuine constraints on upgrading.

### Step 2: Define and communicate a version support policy

The underlying driver of branch proliferation is the absence of a clear policy on how long
versions are supported. Without a policy, support obligations are open-ended.

1. Define a maximum support window. Common choices are N-1 (only the previous major version
   is supported alongside the current), a fixed time window (12 or 18 months), or a fixed number
   of minor releases.
2. Communicate the policy to customers. Give them a migration timeline.
3. Apply the policy retroactively: branches outside the support window are retired, with notice.

This is a business decision, not a technical one. Engineering leadership needs to align with
product and customer success teams. But without a policy, the technical remediation of the
branching problem cannot proceed.

### Step 3: Invest in backward compatibility to reduce upgrade friction (Weeks 2-6)

Many customers stay on old versions because upgrades are painful. If every upgrade requires
configuration changes, API updates, and re-testing, customers defer upgrades indefinitely.
Reducing upgrade friction reduces the business pressure to maintain old versions.

1. Identify the most common upgrade blockers from customer escalations.
2. Add backward compatibility layers: deprecated API endpoints that still work, configuration
   migration tools, clear upgrade guides.
3. For breaking changes, use API versioning rather than code branching. The API maintains the old
   contract while the implementation moves forward.

The goal is that upgrading from N-1 to N is low-risk and well-supported. Customers who can
upgrade easily will, which reduces the population on old versions.

### Step 4: Replace backporting with forward-only fixes on supported versions (Weeks 4-8)

For versions within the support window, stop cherry-picking from trunk. Instead, fix on the oldest
supported version and merge forward.

1. When a bug is reported against version 2.1, fix it on the `release/2.1` branch.
2. Merge the fix forward: 2.1 to 2.2 to 2.3 to trunk.
3. Forward merges are less likely to conflict than backports because the forward merge builds
   on the older fix rather than trying to apply a trunk-context fix to older code.

This is still more work than a single fix on trunk, but it eliminates the class of bugs caused
by backporting a trunk-context fix to incompatible older code.

### Step 5: Reduce to one supported release branch alongside trunk (Weeks 6-12)

Work toward a state where only the most recent release branch is maintained, with all others
retired.

1. Accelerate customer migrations for all versions outside the N-1 policy.
2. Retire branches as their consumer count reaches zero.
3. For the last remaining release branch, evaluate whether it can be eliminated by using
   feature flags on trunk to manage staged rollouts instead of a separate branch.

Once the team is running trunk and at most one release branch, the maintenance overhead drops
dramatically. Backporting one version is manageable. Backporting five is not.

### Step 6: Move to trunk-only with feature flags and staged rollouts (Ongoing)

The end state is trunk-only. Customers on "the current version" get staged access to new features
through flags. There is one codebase to maintain, one pipeline to run, and one set of tests to
pass.

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Enterprise customers need version stability" | Stability comes from reliable software and good testing, not from freezing the codebase. A customer on a fixed version still gets bugs and security vulnerabilities - they just do not get the fixes either. Feature flags provide stability for individual features without freezing the entire release. |
| "We are contractually obligated to support version N" | A defined support window does not mean unlimited support. Work with legal and sales to scope support commitments to a finite window. Open-ended support obligations grow into maintenance traps. |
| "Merging branches forward creates conflicts too" | Forward merges are lower-risk than backports because the merge direction follows the chronological development. The conflicts that exist reflect genuine code evolution. Invest the effort in forward merges and retire branches on schedule rather than maintaining an ever-growing backward-facing merge burden. |
| "Customers won't upgrade even if we ask them to" | Some will not. That is why the support policy must have teeth. After the policy window, the supported upgrade path is to the current version. Continued support for unsupported versions is a separate, charged engagement, not a default obligation. |

## Measuring Progress

| Metric | What to look for |
|--------|-----------------|
| Number of active release branches | Should decrease toward one and eventually zero |
| Backport operations per sprint | Should decrease as branches are retired |
| Development cycle time | Should decrease as the backport overhead is removed from the development workflow |
| Mean time to repair | Should decrease as fixes no longer need to propagate through multiple branches |
| Bug regression rate on release branches | Should decrease as backporting with conflict resolution is eliminated |
| Integration frequency | Should increase as work consolidates on trunk |
