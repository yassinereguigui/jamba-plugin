## What This Looks Like

A developer uses an AI assistant to implement a feature. The AI produces working code. The
developer glances at it, confirms the tests pass, and commits. In the code review, the
reviewer reads the diff but does not challenge the approach because the tests are green and the
code looks reasonable. Nobody asks: "What is this change supposed to do?" or "What
[acceptance criteria](../../reference/glossary/#acceptance-criteria) did you verify it against?"

The team has adopted AI tooling to move faster, but the review standard has not changed to
match. Before AI, developers implicitly understood intent because they built the solution
themselves. With AI, developers commit code without articulating what it should do or how
they validated it. The gap between "tests pass" and "I verified it does what we need" is
where bugs and vulnerabilities hide.

Common variations:

- **The approval-without-criteria.** The reviewer approves because the tests pass and the
  code is syntactically clean. Nobody checks whether the change satisfies the stated
  acceptance criteria or handles the security constraints defined for the work item.
  Vulnerabilities - SQL injection, broken access control, exposed secrets - ship because
  the reviewer checked that it compiles, not that it meets requirements.
- **The AI-fixes-AI loop.** A bug is found in AI-generated code. The developer asks the AI to
  fix it. The AI produces a patch. The developer commits the patch without revisiting what
  the original change was supposed to do or whether the fix satisfies the same criteria.
- **The missing edge cases.** The AI generates code that handles the happy path correctly. The
  developer does not add tests for edge cases because they did not think of them - they
  delegated the thinking to the AI. The AI did not think of them either.
- **The false confidence.** The team's test suite has high line coverage. AI-generated code
  passes the suite. The team believes the code is correct because coverage is high. But
  coverage measures execution, not correctness. Lines are exercised without the assertions
  that would catch wrong behavior.

The telltale sign: when a bug appears in AI-generated code, the developer who committed it
cannot describe what the change was supposed to do or what acceptance criteria it was verified
against.

## Why This Is a Problem

### It creates unverifiable code

Code committed without acceptance criteria is code that nobody can verify later. When a bug
appears three months later, the team has no record of what the change was supposed to do.
They cannot distinguish "the code is wrong" from "the code is correct but the requirements
changed" because the requirements were never stated.

Without documented intent and acceptance criteria, the team treats AI-generated code as a
black box. Black boxes get patched around rather than fixed, accumulating workarounds that
make the code progressively harder to change.

### It introduces security vulnerabilities

AI models generate code based on patterns in training data. Those patterns include insecure
code. An AI assistant will produce code with SQL injection vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets,
missing input validation, or broken authentication flows if the [prompt](../../reference/glossary/#prompt) does not explicitly
constrain against them - and sometimes even if it does.

A developer who defines security constraints as acceptance criteria before generating code
would catch many of these issues because the criteria would include "rejects SQL fragments in
input" or "secrets are read from environment, never hardcoded." Without those criteria, the
developer has nothing to verify against. The vulnerability ships.

### It degrades the team's domain knowledge

When developers delegate implementation to AI and commit without articulating intent and
acceptance criteria, the team stops making domain knowledge explicit. Over time, the criteria
for "correct" exist only in the AI's training data - which is frozen, generic, and unaware of
the team's specific constraints.

This knowledge loss is invisible at first. The team is shipping features faster. But when
something goes wrong - a production incident, an unexpected interaction, a requirement
change - the team discovers they have no documented record of what the system is supposed
to do, only what the AI happened to generate.

### Impact on continuous delivery

[CD](../../reference/glossary/#cd-continuous-delivery) requires that every change is [deployable](../../reference/glossary/#deployable) with high confidence. Confidence comes from
knowing what the change does, verifying it against [acceptance criteria](../../reference/glossary/#acceptance-criteria), and knowing how to
detect if it fails. When developers commit code without articulating intent or criteria, the
confidence is synthetic: based on test results, not on verified requirements.

Synthetic confidence fails under stress. When a production incident involves AI-generated code,
the team's mean time to recovery increases because they have no documented intent to compare
against. When a requirement changes, the developers cannot assess the impact because there is
no record of what the current behavior was supposed to be.

## How to Fix It

### Step 1: Establish the "own it or don't commit it" rule (Week 1)

Add a [working agreement](../../reference/glossary/#working-agreement): any code committed to the repository - regardless of whether a human
or an AI wrote it - must be owned by the committing developer. Ownership means the developer
can answer three questions: what does this change do, what [acceptance criteria](../../reference/glossary/#acceptance-criteria) did I verify
it against, and how would I detect if it were wrong in production?

This does not mean the developer must trace every line of implementation. It means they must
understand the change's intent, its expected behavior, and its validation strategy. The AI
handles the *how*. The developer owns the *what* and the *how do we know it works*. See the
Agent Delivery Contract for how
this ownership model works in practice.

1. Add the rule to the team's working agreements.
2. In code reviews, reviewers ask the author: what does this change do, what criteria did you
   verify, and what would a failure look like? If the author cannot answer, the review is not
   approved until they can.
3. Track how often reviews are sent back for insufficient ownership. This is a leading
   indicator of how often unexamined code was reaching the review stage.

### Step 2: Require acceptance criteria before AI-assisted implementation (Weeks 2-3)

Before a developer asks an AI to implement a feature, the acceptance criteria must be written
and reviewed. The criteria serve two purposes: they constrain the AI's output, and they give
the developer a checklist to verify the result against.

1. Each work item must include specific, testable acceptance criteria before implementation
   starts.
2. AI prompts should reference the acceptance criteria explicitly.
3. The developer verifies the AI output against every criterion before committing.

### Step 3: Add security-focused review for AI-generated code (Weeks 2-4)

AI-generated code has a higher baseline risk of security vulnerabilities because the AI
optimizes for functional correctness, not security.

1. Add static application security testing (SAST) tools to the [pipeline](../../reference/glossary/#pipeline) that flag common vulnerability patterns.
2. For AI-assisted changes, the code review checklist includes: input validation, access
   control, secret handling, and injection prevention.
3. Track the rate of security findings in AI-generated code vs human-written code. If
   AI-generated code has a higher rate, tighten the review criteria.

### Step 4: Strengthen the test suite to catch AI blind spots (Weeks 3-6)

AI-generated code passes your tests. The question is whether your tests are good enough to
catch wrong behavior.

1. Add mutation testing to measure test suite effectiveness. If mutants survive in AI-generated
   code, the tests are not asserting on the right things.
2. Require edge case tests for every AI-generated function: null inputs, boundary values,
   malformed data, concurrent access where applicable.
3. Review test coverage not by lines executed but by behaviors verified. A function with 100%
   line coverage and no assertions on error paths is undertested.

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "This slows down the speed benefit of AI tools" | The speed benefit is real only if the code is correct. Shipping bugs faster is not a speed improvement - it is a rework multiplier. A 10-minute review that catches a vulnerability saves days of incident response. |
| "Our developers are experienced - they can spot problems in AI output" | Experience helps, but scanning code is not the same as verifying it against criteria. Experienced developers who rubber-stamp AI output still miss bugs because they are reviewing implementation rather than checking whether it satisfies stated requirements. The rule creates the expectation to verify against criteria. |
| "We have high test coverage already" | Coverage measures execution, not correctness. A test that executes a code path but does not assert on its behavior provides coverage without confidence. Mutation testing reveals whether the coverage is meaningful. |
| "Requiring developers to explain everything is too much overhead" | The rule is not "trace every line." It is "explain what the change does and how you validated it." A developer who owns the change can answer those questions in two minutes. A developer who cannot answer them should not commit it. |

## Measuring Progress

| Metric | What to look for |
|--------|-----------------|
| Code reviews returned for insufficient ownership | Should start high and decrease as developers internalize the review standard |
| Security findings in AI-generated code | Should decrease as review and static analysis improve |
| Defects in AI-generated code vs human-written code | Should converge as the team applies equal rigor to both |
| Mutation testing survival rate | Should decrease as test assertions become more specific |
| Mean time to resolve defects in AI-generated code | Should decrease as documented intent and criteria make it faster to identify what went wrong |
