## What This Looks Like

The pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys your application is configured through a web interface. Someone with admin access to the CI system logs in, navigates through a series of forms, sets values in text fields, and clicks save. The pipeline definition lives in the CI tool's internal database. There is no file in the source repository that describes what the pipeline does.

When a new team member asks how the pipeline works, the answer is "log into Jenkins and look at the job configuration." When something breaks, the investigation requires comparing the current UI configuration against what someone remembers it looking like before the last change. When the CI system needs to be migrated to a new server or a new tool, the pipeline must be recreated from scratch by a person who remembers what it did - or by reading through the broken system's UI before it is taken offline.

Changes to the pipeline accumulate the same way changes to any unversioned file accumulate. An administrator adjusts a timeout value to fix a flaky step and does not document the change. A developer adds a build parameter to accommodate a new service and does not tell anyone. A security team member modifies a credential reference and the change is invisible to the development team. Six months later nobody knows who changed what or when, and the pipeline has diverged from any documentation that was written about it.

Common variations:

- **Freestyle Jenkins jobs.** Pipeline logic is distributed across multiple job configurations, shell script fields, and plugin settings in the Jenkins UI, with no Jenkinsfile in the repository.
- **UI-configured GitHub Actions workflows.** While GitHub Actions uses YAML files, some teams configure repository settings, secrets, and environment protection rules only through the UI with no documentation or infrastructure-as-code equivalent.
- **Undocumented plugin dependencies.** The pipeline depends on specific versions of CI plugins that are installed and updated through the CI tool's plugin manager UI, with no record of which versions are required.
- **Shared library configuration drift.** A shared pipeline library is used but its version pinning is configured in each job through the UI rather than in code, causing different jobs to run different library versions silently.

The telltale sign: if the CI system's database were deleted tonight, it would be impossible to recreate the pipeline from source control alone.

## Why This Is a Problem

A pipeline that exists only in a UI is infrastructure that cannot be reviewed, audited, rolled back, or reproduced.

### It reduces quality

A security scan can be silently removed from the pipeline with a few UI clicks and no one on the team will know until an incident surfaces the gap. Pipeline changes that go through a UI bypass the review process that code changes go through. A developer who wants to add a test stage to the pipeline submits a pull request that gets reviewed, discussed, and approved. A developer who wants to skip a test stage in the pipeline can make that change in the CI UI with no review and no record. The pipeline - which is the quality gate for all application changes - has weaker quality controls applied to it than the application code it governs.

This asymmetry creates real risk. The pipeline is the system that enforces quality standards: it runs the tests, it checks the coverage, it scans for vulnerabilities, it validates the artifact. When changes to the pipeline are unreviewed and untracked, any of those checks can be weakened or removed without the team noticing. A pipeline that silently has its security scan disabled is indistinguishable from one that never had a security scan.

Version-controlled pipeline definitions bring pipeline changes into the same review process as application changes. A pull request that removes a required test stage is visible, reviewable, and reversible, the same as a pull request that removes application code.

### It increases rework

When a pipeline breaks and there is no version history, diagnosing what changed is a forensic exercise. Someone must compare the current pipeline configuration against their memory of how it worked before, look for recent admin activity logs if the CI system keeps them, and ask colleagues if they remember making any changes. This investigation is slow, imprecise, and often inconclusive.

Worse, pipeline bugs that are fixed by UI changes create no record of the fix. The next time the same bug occurs - or when the pipeline is migrated to a new system - the fix must be rediscovered from scratch. Teams in this state frequently solve the same pipeline problem multiple times because the institutional knowledge of the solution is not captured anywhere durable.

Version-controlled pipelines allow pipeline problems to be debugged with standard git tooling: `git log` to see recent changes, `git blame` to find who changed a specific line, `git revert` to undo a change that caused a regression. The same toolchain used to understand application changes can be applied to the pipeline itself.

### It makes delivery timelines unpredictable

An unversioned pipeline creates fragile recovery scenarios. When the CI system goes down - a disk failure, a cloud provider outage, a botched upgrade - recovering the pipeline requires either restoring from a backup of the CI tool's internal database or rebuilding the pipeline configuration from scratch. If no backup exists or the backup is from a point before recent changes, the recovery is incomplete and potentially slow.

For teams practicing CD, pipeline downtime is delivery downtime. Every hour the pipeline is unavailable is an hour during which no changes can be verified or deployed. A pipeline that can be recreated from source control in minutes by running a script is dramatically more recoverable than one that requires an experienced administrator to reconstruct from memory over several hours.

### Impact on continuous delivery

CD requires that the delivery process itself be reliable and reproducible. The pipeline is the delivery process. A pipeline that cannot be recreated from source control is a pipeline with unknown reliability characteristics - it works until it does not, and when it does not, recovery is slow and uncertain.

Infrastructure-as-code principles apply to the pipeline as much as to the application infrastructure. A Jenkinsfile or a GitHub Actions workflow file committed to the repository, subject to the same review and versioning practices as application code, is the CD-compatible approach. The pipeline definition should travel with the code it builds and be subject to the same rigor.

## How to Fix It

### Step 1: Export and document the current pipeline configuration

Capture the current pipeline state before making any changes. Most CI tools have an export or configuration-as-code option. For Jenkins, the Job DSL or Configuration as Code plugin can export job definitions. For other systems, document the pipeline stages, parameters, environment variables, and credentials references manually. This export becomes the starting point for the source-controlled version.

### Step 2: Write the pipeline definition as code (Weeks 2-3)

Translate the exported configuration into a pipeline-as-code format appropriate for your CI system. Jenkins uses Jenkinsfiles with declarative or scripted pipeline syntax. GitHub Actions uses YAML workflow files in `.github/workflows/`. GitLab CI uses `.gitlab-ci.yml`. The goal is a file in the repository that completely describes the pipeline behavior, such that the CI system can execute it with no additional UI configuration required.

### Step 3: Validate that the code-defined pipeline matches the UI pipeline

Run both pipelines on the same commit and compare outputs. The code-defined pipeline should produce the same artifacts, run the same tests, and execute the same deployment steps as the UI-defined pipeline. Investigate and reconcile any differences. This validation step is important - subtle behavioral differences between the old and new pipelines can introduce regressions.

### Step 4: Migrate CI system configuration to infrastructure as code (Weeks 4-5)

Beyond the pipeline definition itself, the CI system has configuration: installed plugins, credential stores, agent definitions, and folder structures. Where the CI system supports it, bring this configuration under infrastructure-as-code management as well. Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC), Terraform providers for CI systems, or the CI system's own CLI can automate configuration management. Document what cannot be automated as explicit setup steps in a runbook committed to the repository.

### Step 5: Require pipeline changes to go through pull requests

Establish a policy that pipeline definitions are changed only through the source-controlled files, never through direct UI edits. Configure branch protection to require review on changes to pipeline files. If the CI system allows UI overrides, disable or restrict that access. The pipeline file should be the authoritative source of truth - the UI is a read-only view of what the file defines.

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Our pipeline is too complex to describe in a single file." | Complex pipelines often benefit most from being in source control because their complexity makes undocumented changes especially risky. Use shared libraries or template mechanisms to manage complexity rather than keeping the pipeline in a UI. |
| "The CI admin team controls the pipeline and does not work in our repository." | Pipeline-as-code can be maintained in a separate repository from the application code. The important property is that it is in version control and subject to review, not that it is in the same repository. |
| "We do not know how to write pipeline code for our CI system." | All major CI systems have documentation and community examples for their pipeline-as-code formats. The learning curve is typically a few hours for basic pipelines. Start with a simple pipeline and expand incrementally. |
| "We use proprietary plugins that do not have code equivalents." | Document plugin dependencies in the repository even if the plugin itself must be installed manually. The dependency is then visible, reviewable, and reproducible - which is most of the value. |

## Measuring Progress

| Metric | What to look for |
|--------|-----------------|
| Build duration | Stable and predictable pipeline duration once the pipeline definition is version-controlled and changes are reviewed |
| Change fail rate | Fewer pipeline-related failures as unreviewed configuration changes are eliminated |
| Mean time to repair | Faster pipeline recovery when the pipeline can be recreated from source control rather than reconstructed from memory |
| Lead time | Reduction in pipeline downtime contribution to delivery lead time |
